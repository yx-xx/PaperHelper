AbstractReduced-order-based optimal control techniques for
humanoid locomotion struggle to adapt step duration and place-
ment simultaneously in dynamic walking gaits due to their
reliance on fixed-time discretization, which limits responsiveness
to various disturbances and results in suboptimal performance
in challenging conditions. In this work, we propose a Gait-
Net-augmented implicit kino-dynamic model-predictive control
(MPC) to simultaneously optimize step location, step duration,
and contact forces for natural variable-frequency locomotion. The
proposed method incorporates a Gait-Net-augmented Sequential
Convex MPC algorithm to solve multi-linearly constrained vari-
ables by iterative quadratic programs. At its core, a lightweight
Gait-frequency Network (Gait-Net) determines the preferred step
duration in terms of variable MPC sampling times, simplifying
step duration optimization to the parameter level. Additionally, it
enhances and updates the spatial reference trajectory within each
sequential iteration by incorporating local solutions, allowing the
projection of kinematic constraints to the design of reference
trajectories. We validate the proposed algorithm in high-fidelity
simulations and on small-size humanoid hardware, demonstrat-
ing its capability for variable-frequency and 3-D discrete terrain
locomotion with only a one-step preview of terrain data.
I. INTRODUCTION
Contactfootstep planning is a fundamental problem in hu-
manoid robot motion control. Due to the inherent instability
of these robots, efficient integration of both contact planning
and motion control is an essential step to enable dynamic and
robust locomotion across diverse terrains.
A. Contact Planning
Footstep planning has traditionally been treated as a high-
ecution [1, 2, 3, 4]. For instance, Deits and Tedrake  ad-
dresses 3D humanoid footstep planning using a highly efficient
mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic program
(MIQCQP) to compute trajectories in seconds. In addition,
Bouyarmane and Kheddar  proposes a best-first algorithm
for collision-free multi-contact planning in humanoid loco-
manipulation. However, these offline trajectories, tracked by
whole-body control or inverse-kinematics-based controllers,
often suffer from error accumulation over long trajectories due
to their open-loop nature.
Contact-implicit model-predictive control (CI-MPC) has
gained popularity for optimizing contact force, location, and
timing within a unified framework by addressing the linear

complementarity problem (LCP) between contact velocity and
force [5, 6, 7]. These frameworks integrate contact planning
and motion control to generate optimal contact behaviors in
real-time. However, CI-MPC involves solving highly complex,
nonlinear problems with significant computational demands.
While Le Cleach et al.  precompute LCP parameters offline
to improve online speed, this process remains costly and must
be repeated for each new setup.
B. Humanoid Locomotion with Simplified Models
Convex MPC (CMPC) is widely used in legged locomotion
as single rigid-body model (SRBM) , for fast and high-
frequency control by optimizing ground reaction forces. How-
linearization. Foot placement is typically determined sepa-
rately using heuristics (e.g., Raibert heuristic ), capture
point methods , or optimizations with the linear inverted
pendulum model . These approaches embed predefined
step durations (a.k.a., one-step gait duration), making it chal-
lenging to invert the problem and determine duration from
foot location, especially in 3-D. Feed-forward step duration
is also suboptimal for adaptive strategies on uneven terrain,
where step duration should highly correlate with stride length
and current foot actuation.
Centroidal dynamics (CD) is widely used in humanoid
robot control for its simplified yet effective representation
of whole-body dynamics, making it suitable for real-time
planning and control . CD-MPC and kino-dynamic MPC
are often formulated as nonlinear MPC (NMPC) problems
[14, 15, 16]. Garca et al.  leverages CMPC formulation
and CD-augmented SRBM to include link inertia. However,
the framework still requires predefined gait schedules and the
generation of footstep locations from separate modules. Ad-
MPC by explicitly optimizing joint states, ensuring feasible
whole-body motions . In contrast, CD-MPC lacks kine-
matic coupling between foot location and floating base states,
often necessitating lower-level inverse kinematics (IK) motion
generation  or whole-body control . In our work,
the implicit kino-dynamic MPC aids kinematic assurance and
eliminates the need to optimize joint states.
C. Challenges in Variable Frequency Locomotion
Variable gait frequency locomotion remains under-explored
in humanoid robotics. Previous works have primarily ad-
dressed this problem at the footstep planning level [21, 22,
the MIT humanoid robot demonstrates impressive performance
with whole-body MPC , its gait frequency is fixed and
determined by the MPC sampling time. Li and Nguyen
optimize gait frequency offline for stepping stone terrain, but
the open-loop approach lacks real-time adjustments based
on state feedback. In contrast, our work enables variable-
frequency bipedal walking by concurrently optimizing foot
step planning together in one optimization.
Gait frequency can be integrated into the MPC framework
by optimizing the sampling time per step with a fixed contact
schedule. However, this introduces a multi-linear coupling of
foot location, contact force, and sampling time, significantly
increasing problem complexity and solving time. To address
sequential QP (SQP) solver that efficiently handles these multi-
linear terms through iteratively solving QP problems.
D. Learning-augmented Optimization-based Control
Learning-based control methods, such as reinforcement
learning (RL), have achieved significant success in legged
locomotion [27, 28, 29, 30]. For example, Wang et al.
demonstrated natural locomotion over discrete stepping-stone
terrains. However, the terrain configurations were limited to
segments encountered during the second stage of training.
On the other hand, model-based approaches have also gained
from learning-based techniques [32, 33, 34, 35]. For example,
pre-trained neural networks (NN) can approximate complex,
computationally intensive nonlinear functions, as shown in
, where an NN predicts centroidal inertia evolution, elim-
inating the need for complex spatial momentum computations
in optimization. In this work, we address the weak correlation
between gait frequency and foot location, an inherent limita-
tion of simplified dynamics models such as SRBM and CD,
by introducing Gait-Net, an NN that is trained on data from
variable-gait-frequency MPC with whole-body dynamics.
E. Contributions
The main contributions are twofold. Firstly, we propose
a novel Gait-Net-augmented Implicit Kino-dynamic MPC
framework that concurrently optimizes foot contact force,
foot location, and footstep duration. In this framework, we
introduce supervised learning in a sequential CMPC algorithm
to efficiently solve NMPC with multi-linear constraints.
work (Gait-Net) to form an implicit kino-dynamic MPC. In
each sequential MPC iteration, Gait-Net (1) determines the
preferred step duration in terms of MPC sampling time dt,
transforming dt from a decision variable to a parameter for
efficiency; and (2) improves the estimation of reference spatial
momentum and pose trajectories to mimic more closely as
an explicit kino-dynamic approach while eliminating the joint
angles as part of state variables.
