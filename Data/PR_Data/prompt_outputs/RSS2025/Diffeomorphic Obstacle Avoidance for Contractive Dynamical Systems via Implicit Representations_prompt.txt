AbstractEnsuring safety and robustness of robot skills is
becoming crucial as robots are required to perform increasingly
complex and dynamic tasks. The former is essential when
performing tasks in cluttered environments, while the latter is
relevant to overcome unseen task situations. This paper addresses
the challenge of ensuring both safety and robustness in dynamic
robot skills learned from demonstrations. Specifically, we build
on neural contractive dynamical systems to provide robust
extrapolation of the learned skills, while designing a full-body
obstacle avoidance strategy that preserves contraction stability
via diffeomorphic transforms. This is particularly crucial in
complex environments where implicit scene representations, such
as Signed Distance Fields (SDFs), are necessary. To this end, our
framework called Signed Distance Field Diffeomorphic Trans-
contraction-preserving obstacle avoidance. We thoroughly evalu-
ate our framework on synthetic datasets and several real-world
robotic tasks in a kitchen environment. Our results show that our
approach locally adapts the learned contractive vector field while
staying close to the learned dynamics and without introducing
highly-curved motion paths, thus outperforming several state-of-
the-art methods.
I. INTRODUCTION
Teaching robots skills has been a key challenge in robotics
research for over four decades . The dominant paradigm
involves learning robotic skills through expert examples,
commonly referred to as Learning from Demonstration
enabling
complex motion skills, LfD has led to numerous promising
applications
flexible
manufacturing [16, 59], household environments [51, 69],
human-robot collaboration [31, 57, 58], and robot-assisted
minimally invasive surgery , among many others.
For safe operation in human-centric and dynamic settings,
learned skills must be stable and reliable, avoiding unex-
pected movements under unseen situations such as different
task conditions or external perturbations. This highlights the
importance of stable LfD skills . Early efforts to ensure
stability in LfD focused on asymptotic stability criteria, of-
ten leveraging Lyapunov stability [12, 25, 51, 68]. While
Lyapunov stability primarily ensures asymptotic point-wise
relevant trajectories. To address this limitation, researchers
have conceptualized a more general stability criterion, namely
the contraction property of dynamical systems, which guar-

antees exponential convergence to a trajectory [38, 67]. This
concept has been recently leveraged in LfD frameworks, where
a robot skill, represented by a first-order dynamical system, is
endowed with a contractive behavior [4, 9, 54, 62].
In addition to stability, ensuring safety is paramount. This
often demands integrating obstacle avoidance into robot skills
while still providing stability guarantees. In the context of
contractive systems, Huber et al.  introduced the Mod-
ulation Matrix (MM) method to preserve contraction stability
during obstacle avoidance. Subsequently, Beik-Mohammadi
et al.  applied this approach to neural contractive dynamical
systems (NCDS), enabling stable collision-free motion in
the robots task space. Despite these advances, articulated
robotic arms require whole-body obstacle avoidance. While
traditional methods like artificial potential fields  and
recent approaches like Diffeomorphic Transforms (DT) ,
tackle this problem via robust joint-space obstacle avoidance
solutions that account for asymptotic stability, they do not
consider contraction stability guarantees. Therefore, preserving
contraction during whole-body obstacle avoidance remains
largely unexplored, posing a key challenge for robot motion
When considering cluttered and dynamic environments,
such as household settings, conventional obstacle representa-
tions using simple geometric primitives are insufficient [4, 19],
as they rely on coarse approximations and may not be easily
integrated with neural architectures. Instead, a differentiable
implicit distance representation is more advantageous as it
facilitates a fine-grained, real-time, and resource-efficient so-
network architectures. This has led to the rise of Signed
Distance Fields (SDF)s [15, 22, 45, 47], which have recently
been leveraged to learn articulated robot surfaces [11, 30, 36].
In these approaches, the SDF is a function of the robots joint
configuration space. Still, integrating implicit representations
with contraction-preserving obstacle avoidance remains an
open problem. To bride this gap, we propose to combine
the robustness of contraction stability with the precision of
implicit representations for efficient and safe whole-body
obstacle avoidance.

II. RELATED WORK
A. Learning Contractive Dynamical Systems
The use of contractive guarantees in learned dynamical
systems is a growing trend in robot motion skill learning. In
model via three methods: (i) As a regularizer or constraint on
the main skill learning objective [54, 55]; (ii) As a contraction
metric designed to stabilize a non-contractive skill [65, 66];
and (iii) By learning a skill model that is contractive by
design [1, 4, 23, 5]. The latter strategy is the one we follow in
our framework as it provides stronger theoretical and practical
guarantees. We review this set of works in more detail next.
Beik-Mohammadi et al.  introduced Neural Contractive
Dynamical System (NCDS), which inherently embeds the con-
traction property within a Neural Network (NN), thus avoiding
regularizers or a separate model for learning a contraction
metric. NCDS was later extended with regularizers controlling
the systems contraction rate, in addition to conditioning on
task variables and providing contraction-preserving obstacle
avoidance via pullback Riemannian metrics . Similarly,
Jaffe et al.  presented an inherently contractive model,
which leverages diffeomorphisms between the data space
and a latent space to provide global contraction guarantees.
Another approach is followed by Abyaneh et al. , who
propose learning an inherent contractive dynamical system
via recurrent equilibrium networks and coupling layers. We
build upon previous work to learn a contractive dynamical
system via NCDS. However, our approach can be seamlessly
integrated with any contractive dynamical system. Thereby, we
address the contraction-preserving obstacle avoidance prob-
except in [4, 18].
B. Stability-Preserving Obstacle Avoidance
Applying reactive obstacle avoidance in LfD settings re-
quires careful consideration to ensure safe and robust robot
stable dynamical systems. To address this, Khansari-Zadeh and
Billard  enhanced the Harmonic Potential Function ,
which uses potential flows from fluid mechanics for obstacle
tems maintain stability via an MM. Later, Huber et al.
demonstrated that this approach can also preserve contraction
et al.  primarily relied on simple geometric primitives
for obstacle avoidance, Fourie et al.  employed learned
obstacle representations of the entire robot configuration space
combined with MM. Their work, conducted in parallel to our
contraction stability guarantees.
Building on prior work in learning stable dynamical systems
via diffeomorphisms [44, 51, 68, 70], Zhi et al.  introduced
the DT method, which defines an obstacle-avoidance diffeo-
morphism via a flow field. This diffeomorphism transforms
the learned dynamics while providing asymptotically-stable
obstacle avoidance. Importantly, the DT method also accounts
for joint-space stable skills using the Moore-Penrose inverse
and the robots forward kinematics. This work, however,
shared a limitation with some of the foregoing approaches:
A focus on asymptotic stability rather than the more general
contraction property. In summary, whole-body obstacle avoid-
ance methods that preserve contraction, especially in complex
remains unresolved.
