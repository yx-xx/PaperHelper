the manipulation process toward the desired outcome rather than expecting the robot to precisely execute any trajectories.
The example demonstrates the systems two major components: 1) progressively identify environmental constraints to localize
the target hole; 2) form a constant contact between the inclined peg and its corresponding corner from the hole to serve as
motion constraints for insertion renement. Such an uncertainty-absorbing paradigm is formulated based on the composition of
manipulation funnels a concept that guarantees a strict space shrinkage through task-specic interactions, in the perception

physical uncertainties from contact-rich interactions that easily
exceed the allowed clearance. In this paper, we study how to lever-
age contact between the peg and its matching hole to eliminate
uncertainties in the assembly process under unstructured settings.
By examining the role of compliance under contact constraints,
we present a manipulation system that plans collision-inclusive
interactions for the peg to 1) iteratively identify its task envi-
ronment to localize the target hole and 2) exploit environmental
contact constraints to rene insertion motions into the target hole
without relying on precise perception, enabling a robust solution
to peg-in-hole assembly. By conceptualizing the above process
as the composition of funneling in different state spaces, we
present a formal approach to constructing manipulation funnels
as an uncertainty-absorbing paradigm for peg-in-hole assembly.
The proposed system effectively generalizes across diverse peg-
in-hole scenarios across varying scales, shapes, and materials in a
learning-free manner. Extensive experiments on a NIST Assembly
Task Board (ATB) and additional challenging scenarios validate
its robustness in real-world applications.
I. INTRODUCTION
Robotic peg-in-hole assembly is a foundational skill in
various industrial applications and beyond, involving inserting
a peg into its matching hole on another object under tight clear-
ances . Common strategies seek to optimize the insertion
trajectory under certain conditions, either through explicitly
modeling the task environment or formulating the problem
as a POMDP  (partially observable Markov decision
process) to enable reactive policies based on sensory input.
Regardless of the debate on how accurately a model describes
manipulation lies in the execution . It is the execution
that brings the optimized result from planning into the real
world through motor actuation by the controller. However,
real-world perception challenges and physical uncertainties,
such as those arising from hardware limitations, can introduce
small deviations between planned and executed trajectories.
Under the tight tolerance of peg-in-hole assembly, even minor
uncertainties can lead to undesired manipulation outcomes.
effort to tackle real-world uncertainties beyond solely planned
trajectories.
Acknowledging that planned trajectories are rarely executed
perfectly in the real world due to uncertainties, focusing on
the outcomes of interactions between the system and the
environment [15, 14], rather than on explicit trajectories, offers
a promising approach to achieving robust manipulation. This
formulation often requires the role of compliance, either from
mechanical design [12, 42] or computational simulation ,
to passively adapt to external contacts. Rather than causing
undesired outcomes, environmental constraints can shape the
compliant manipulation process toward the desired outcome
under deliberate exploitation , even without elaborate con-
tact models [44, 8]. With this insight, we propose leveraging
the contacts between the peg and its matching hole as an
advantage to eliminate uncertainties for ne insertions.
In this paper, we introduce a manipulation system (shown
in Fig. 1) that plans compliant interactions between the
manipulated peg and its task environment to identify and
exploit contact constraints for robust insertion. Safe contact
is ensured by impedance control , which allows external
contact to alter the pose of the peg by mimicking a spring-
damper behavior. Since the steady pose of the peg after
each interaction is observable and is a combined effect of
the environmental constraints and potential from impedance
to shrink the target holes proposal distribution progressively
and 2) exploit the environmental constraints to shape the
motion of the peg to enter its matching hole. Specically,
the exploitation process involves maintaining constant contact
between the peg and the hole to serve as motion constraints.
Since the environmental constraints can shape a large margin
of uncertainties and the interaction mechanism of force-pose
regulation is independent of the specic trajectory taken, the
proposed system can tolerate uncertainties smaller than its
execution precision, even under tight tolerances.
As the system dynamics progressively eliminates uncer-
tainty in perception and execution, we formulate the proposed
system as a composition of manipulation funnels in different
state spaces. The original concept of the manipulation funnel
was introduced by Mason  to eliminate uncertainties in ob-
ject location, emphasizing that the robustness of funnel-based
manipulation requires the co-design of robot interaction and
task mechanics. A general formulation of the funneling process
can be dened in any task-relevant space as a progressive
space shrinkage for uncertainty elimination. Inspired by the
planar theory of automatic motion synthesis , we establish
a formal approach to constructing manipulation funnels for
robust ne insertion of general prismatic pegs in the real world.
The primary contributions of this paper are:
We present an uncertainty-absorbing paradigm for general
peg-in-hole insertion based on the concept of manipula-
tion funnel, which does not plan on the explicit trajecto-
ries but rather the outcome of each compliant interaction.
We present a formal approach to constructing the funnel-
ing process for both perception and execution, which can
be further composed for general peg-in-hole insertion.
We provide a system with detailed algorithms to imple-
ment the above funnel-based manipulation paradigm on
real-world assembly tasks.
We conduct ablation studies through extensive experi-
ments on a standard assembly benchmark NIST ATB and
additional challenging tasks to validate the robustness and
generalizability of the proposed paradigm and system.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
reviews related works. Section III introduces the preliminaries
and problem statement for funnel-based manipulation planning
in peg-in-hole assembly. Section IV introduces the task me-
chanics and presents a formal approach to constructing manip-
ulation funnels in perception and execution. Section V demon-
strates the robustness of the proposed system in simulation
and real-world experiments. We discuss the limitations under
current settings in Section VI and summarize the contributions
in Section VII.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Peg-in-Hole Assembly
Over the past decade, pipeline-based and end-to-end ap-
proaches have driven advancements in robotic peg-in-hole
systems. Pipeline-based approaches aim to explicitly esti-
mate intermediate system states for motion planning. Previous
works [25, 51, 27] leverage tactile or forcetorque sensors
for contact state estimation. Vision-based methods [54, 21]
estimate alignment deviations for correction or search motion
planning. This modular design provides interpretability and
data-driven methods. In contrast, end-to-end approaches
aim at deriving an implicit function to map sensory inputs to
motor skills from trial-and-error. The entire system connects
feature extraction to planning in a unied manner [13, 37, 50,
ciple that assembly is a relative positioning task , as-
suming the robot will precisely execute the issued trajectory.
Our research targets a different perspective , as the ne
insertion motion is a passive renement process that exploits
environmental constraints.

manipulation often involves compensation for uncertainty
and safe interaction with the environment, which has been
adopted in a wide range of tasks, including dexterous grasp-
ing [6, 33, 12], in-hand manipulation [32, 41, 2], grasp
adaptation [31, 19, 26], assembly [40, 38, 55] and human-
robot co-manipulation [47, 43].
environmental constraints to eliminate uncertainties, ensuring
robust and dexterous manipulation [14, 20, 11, 46, 56, 23, 7].
In this work, we propose a formal approach for compliance-

uncertainty in insertion motions.
