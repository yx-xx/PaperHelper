presents a significant challenge due to complex aerodynamic
destabilize vehicles and degrade performance. Traditionally,
multi-quadrotor systems rely on conservative strategies, such as
collision avoidance zones around the robot volume, to circumvent
this effect. This restricts their capabilities by requiring a large
volume for the operation of a multi-quadrotor system, limiting
their applicability in dense environments. This work provides a
a focus on characterizing, analyzing, and understanding forces,
configurations. We use measurements of forces and torques to
characterize vehicle interactions and particle image velocimetry
(PIV) to quantify the spatial features of the downwash wake for a
single quadrotor and an interacting pair of quadrotors. This data
can be used to inform physics-based strategies for coordination,
leverage downwash for optimized formations, expand the enve-
lope of operation, and improve the robustness of multi-quadrotor
control.
I. INTRODUCTION
Quadrotor teams have found widespread use in numerous
agriculture [21, 14], and infrastructure inspection . How-
formations of quadrotors due to the aerodynamic interference
of rotor wakes, posing a significant challenge in advancing
multi-robot aerial systems. Although this downwash effect
has been recognized in helicopter aerodynamics , re-
search into its impact on small-scale aerial vehicles, such
as quadrotors, is still in its infancy. Accurate analysis and
understanding of this effect can extend use cases for efficient
close proximity applications such as aerial docking , large-
scale trajectory planning of quadrotor teams [26, 24], sensor
currently avoid tight formation flight due to the unacceptable
risks in maintaining stable flight.
Detailed characterization of downwash effects, including
establishes a foundational empirical basis for aerodynamic
interactions that can be used in physics-based modeling and
learning-based approaches, essential for the future develop-
ment of more sophisticated control strategies. Incorporating
physics-based knowledge into data-driven methods has been
proven to enable more sample-efficient learning [29, 6], re-
quiring fewer real-world trials to achieve reliable performance
for dense formation flight.

A. Contributions
The contributions of this paper are twofold. Firstly, we
characterize the effect of downwash on forces, moments, and
velocities acting on a pair of quadrotors flying in close prox-
imity as a function of their relative separation. Quantifying
these critical variables provides a foundation for understanding
the magnitudes of destabilizing effects in dense formations,
aiding in model development for control. The influence of
the separation between quadrotors and its subsequent im-
pact on downwash is emphasized. We develop an algebraic
reduced-order model of quadrotor downwash that exhibits the
characteristic scaling behavior of canonical turbulent round
jets. Further characterization and analyses detailed herein
provide a valuable open-access dataset for the multi-robot
by avoiding flying within zones where downwash influence is
dominant [22, 26, 24, 10].

B. Related Work
wash from quadrotors has gained traction due to its critical im-
pact on the stability, performance, and efficiency of quadrotor
systems [12, 29, 4]. Previous work has considered downwash
in collision avoidance by modeling quadrotor volume as
cylinders [22, 11] or axially-aligned ellipsoids [26, 3, 2], with
a more extensive range along the axial direction of downwash
influence. For collision avoidance, Preiss et al. used a vertical
istic scaling length, defined as the distance between the vehicle
and rotor centers) and a horizontal separation of x  24 cm
(xl 7.4) between two small quadrotors (Crazyflies )
in their experiments . However, these models employ
predefined arbitrary separation between quadrotors, without
factoring in flight physics. Therefore, a critical gap remains in
understanding the spatial influence of downwash on quadrotor
interactions at a fundamental level.
Models based on first principles provide a foundation for
quantifying established downstream flow profiles but struggle
to capture the full range of aerodynamic effects, particularly in
both the near-field and far-field regions [31, 17]. Motivated by
the interaction between quadrotors, Jain et al. measured the de-
cay of the rotor wake below a large, and a small quadrotor ,
and Yeo et al. measured the decay of the downwash below
varying scales of aerial vehicles with propeller diameters
ranging from small quadrotors, l 20 cm to helicopters,
l 50 cm , fitting parameters to a Gaussian velocity
decay profile. In both these studies, anemometers were placed
at an arbitrary downstream distance, assuming that the wake
velocity had a Gaussian profile. While numerical simulations
have demonstrated their ability to capture complex downwash
wake structure , they are primarily limited in their flow
field area due to computational complexity. However, the effect
of downwash and its subsequent wake is strongly influenced
by the relative proximity between quadrotors, necessitating
accurate modeling of downwash for a comprehensive mapping
both in the near-field and far-field regions for dense forma-
tions [6, 29].
mensional units for specific quadrotors, making it difficult
to scale these findings to other vehicles or to reproduce the
data in different contexts. Although it is possible to normalize
other results, doing so retroactively can be nontrivial without
detailed information on the custom designs or operating pa-
rameters of the vehicles. Hence, it is unclear if these velocity
of quadrotors of varying scales and sizes. Our findings address
this gap by systematically characterizing and analyzing these
normalized flow variables using Crazyflie quadrotors, which
are widely adopted for research and experimental applications.
Most recently, Bauersfeld et al. explored interesting quadro-
tor wake structure, including the merging of rotor jets, but
relied on a low-bandwidth, relatively large velocity probe to
measure the wake structure below a range of commercial
quadrotors . In this work, we employ particle image ve-
locimetry (PIV) , a measurement technique that captures
spatially resolved flow fields. PIV provides finer details inac-
cessible to lower-resolution counterparts such as anemometers,
which provide point measurements that must be extrapolated
for spatial insights, compromising high-fidelity aerodynamic
modeling. Our findings offer insights critical for validating and
extending canonical models on turbulent jets  for quadrotor
downwash wakes.
While existing work has targeted avoiding the region of
downwash due to destabilizing effects, this paper aims to
understand and characterize these interactions, paving the way
for quadrotors to operate within this region rather than avoid
it. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of this
aerodynamic phenomenon, this work lays the groundwork
for developing robust control strategies to increase the flight
envelope and performance in close-proximity multi-quadrotor
systems.
II. METHODOLOGY
Consider a pair of quadrotors flying in close proximity, one
below the other. Our approach aims to quantify the aerody-
namic influence on close proximity flight for both quadrotors,
specifically the effect of downwash from the upper quadrotor
on the lower quadrotor.
Two sample cases of the effects of quadrotor downwash are
shown in Fig. 2. Here, two quadrotors fly one above the other
in a vertically aligned configuration (left) and a horizontally
offset configuration (right).
Fig. 2: Close proximity quadrotor flight under the influence of downwash; Case I (left)
depicts vertical alignment with quadrotors (A) and (B) in a stacked configuration. Case
II (right) illustrates quadrotor (B) horizontally offset from quadrotor (A). Black arrows
adjacent to the rotors indicate their direction of rotation. In this figure, F represents
In this work, we present an in-depth data analysis from
experiments performed on quadrotors mounted to a custom
translation stage that allows precise relative positioning of the
quadrotors within a PIV test environment while preventing
roll and yaw. These experiments were conducted in a wind-
free environment to ensure that the setup closely mimics the
free-flight conditions of the quadrotors in an indoor laboratory
flight space. The study focuses on the effective change in thrust
and pitch moment of the quadrotors due to the influence of
as in Fig. 3.
In case I, quadrotors (A) and (B) are in a stacked con-
figuration (Fig. 2). Vertically aligned rotors in this config-
uration rotate in the same direction, and the jet from the
upper downwash-generating quadrotor (A) directly impacts the
propellers of the quadrotor below (B), significantly affecting
its performance and stability. This is because the downwash
jet from the upper quadrotor (A) modifies the inflow of the
lower quadrotor (B) due to the substantial induced airflow
generated below the downwash-generating quadrotor. Thus,
the thrust, Fz, generated by the lower quadrotor (B) is expected
to be strongly affected when the quadrotors are in a stacked
configuration.
Case II considers quadrotors (A) and (B) with some hori-
zontal offset. With increasing horizontal displacement from the
initial stacked case, the pitch moment, My, acting on the lower
quadrotor from the downwash-generating quadrotor above
arm displacement. Destabilization induced by this pitching
moment requires a restoring moment to retain stability. As
the horizontal separation increases from this offset, the pitch
moment decreases until no influence is felt by either quadrotor.
A. Experiment Methods
The experimental setup (Fig. 3) consists of two Crazyflie
quadrotors mounted on a x z translation stage. Quadrotor
(B) is fixed while quadrotor (A) traverses a wide range of
horizontal (x) and vertical (z) separations using stepper
motor controllers with a position accuracy of 100 m. Both
quadrotors are mounted on 6 DOF forcetorque transducers
(ATI Nano-17).
Fig. 3: Coordinate system and setup schematic to measure aerodynamic interactions on
forces and moments acting on a pair of quadrotors.
All four motors on both quadrotors are operated with
a constant DC voltage supply (through a tether) of 4 V
at a converted bit-PWM signal for hover, commanded via
Crazyradio . This generates a total thrust sufficient to
maintain steady-state hover in free flight. At this setting, the
rotors rotate at approximately 320 Hz. Note that the Crazyflie
quadrotor control hardware suite maintains constant voltage,
not constant rotational frequency. We conducted two sets of
another for velocity measurements. The specific cases for each
of these measurements are outlined below:
1) Force  Moment measurements: The relative position
between quadrotors (x, z) was varied over a rectangular
test matrix ranging 0.1 m x 0.6 m horizontally, and
0.1 m z 1.1 m vertically. Evaluating a larger range for
vertical versus horizontal separation was guided by the axis-
aligned ellipsoid model  and the cylindrical model ,
which suggest that downwash develops more significantly
in the axial (vertical) direction, and is further supported by
experimental data in our study (cf. Figs. 5, 6, 7a). We recorded
force and moment measurements from both quadrotors at
a sampling rate of 20 kHz for 30 seconds at each relative
position; each case was repeated three times, and the standard
deviation was computed from these trials.
2) Velocity measurements: Extreme instances of the down-
wash effect, illustrated in Fig. 2, guided our selection of
cases for velocity measurements. Velocity measurements were
performed in the stacked configuration (case I) and the off-
set configuration (case II) at the closest vertical separation
(zl  4) as in force and moment measurements. To
complement these, we also included a farther vertical sepa-
ration case (zl  12.5) for both the stacked and offset
configurations. This resulted in a total of four multi-vehicle
PIV configurations for velocity measurements. Additionally, a
fifth case was included to capture the flow field below a single
rotor jets and their wake structure in the absence of vehicle-
vehicle interaction, serving as a baseline for comparison with
the multi-vehicle cases.
PIV provides a quantitative measure of velocities generated
above and below the rotors. Small (m) tracer droplets of
Di-Ethyl-Hexyl-Sebacic-Acid-Ester (DEHS) were suspended
in the flow field and tracked under the influence of downwash.
The PIV system used a Quantel Evergreen dual-cavity Nd:Yag
laser (532 nm, max pulse energy: 200 mJ  15 Hz) to
illuminate the tracer particles. The laser sheet was aligned to
illuminate a plane passing through the center of the front two
rotors in the cross configuration, as shown by the top view
in Fig. 4. Reflective surfaces, including motors, were properly
masked and coated with anti-reflective paint to ensure detailed
flow visualization. Particle motion was captured by a LaVision
Imager sCMOS camera (2560  2160 pixels) equipped with a
Nikon 35 mm lens, offering a field of view of 400  300 mm
(x  z). A total of 1000 image pairs containing velocity fields
were recorded, representing 70 seconds of data, and processed
using DaVis v10 (LaVision), using multipass correlations with
a final interrogation area of 32  32 pixels and a 75 overlap.
To cover the far-field wake structure for a single quadrotor,
and regions above and below both quadrotors in stacked and
offset configurations, the quadrotors were raised and lowered
on the xz translational stage, keeping their relative position,
the laser light sheet, and the camera fixed, to image the flow
fields in sections. The average velocity field from each section
was combined to form a composite flow field covering a
larger vertical range. Each section had a minimum overlap
Fig. 4: PIV setup for quadrotor downwash velocity data acquisition. The laser sheet
illuminates the tracer particles along the plane (side-view), slicing through the centers
of the front two rotors of the quadrotors (top-view), capturing the flow field along that
with adjacent sections of 100 mm, one-third of the z-direction
measurement range, to ensure a smooth transition and maintain
spatial resolution when stitching sections together.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Forces  Moments
In Figs. 6a and 6c, the forces and moments experienced by
the lower quadrotor are dramatically altered by the downwash
generated from the upper vehicle. The thrust generated by the
quadrotors is normalized by their weight, W (0.265 N),
and the pitch moment, My is normalized by Wl, where l is
the horizontal distance from the Crazyflie quadrotors body
center to a motor (32.5 mm) depicted in Fig. 3. The effective
downwash intensity peaks for the lower quadrotor when both
vehicles are placed in the stacked configuration (vertical align-
ment), and at the closest vertical separation (zl  4), the
thrust significantly drops to 65 of its nominal hover thrust.
As the downwash-inducing upper quadrotor translates away
horizontally and vertically relative to the lower quadrotor,
it recovers its nominal hover thrust, balancing its lift with
its weight, W. The lower quadrotors thrust attains unaltered
levels at (xl 3) and (zl 19). Regions within these
limits represent areas of downwash influence, consistent with
the axially-aligned ellipsoid model , which states that the
downwash effect is more pronounced in the axial direction
than in the lateral direction.
For zl > 19, there is a negligible effect from downwash
on the bottom quadrotor. At this vertical separation, the thrust
generated by the lower quadrotor ranges between 95 - 98
of its hover thrust, as seen in Fig. 6a. For xl > 3.7,
the effect of downwash on thrust has nearly diminished.
In contrast, we observe that the downwash-producing upper
quadrotor experiences only a slight reduction in its thrust
as seen in Fig. 5a. Even at the closest vertical separation
(zl  4) from the lower quadrotor, the upper quadrotor
retains 90 of its original hover thrust.
In addition to the magnitudes of normalized thrust due
to downwash, we quantify the unsteadiness associated with
downwash based on the standard deviation of the normalized
z. The unsteadiness associated with downwash lingers
until vertical separation zl 17 and horizontal separation
xl 4.5 (cf. Figs. 5b and 6b). Similar to the effect
on thrust, the unsteadiness remains pronounced when the
quadrotors align vertically up to (zl 14). The standard
deviation of relative thrust, F
z is of much higher magnitude
for the lower quadrotor compared to the upper quadrotor,
the upper quadrotor experiences turbulence approximately two
orders of magnitude smaller than the lower quadrotor. The
flow eventually becomes steady, as seen by the diminishing
influence of fluctuating forces for 14 < zl < 17. The
vertical separations contain regions of unsteadiness spread
over a range that is three times that of separations on the
horizontal scale. For separations zl > 17 and xl > 4.5,
the unsteadiness associated with downwash can be considered
negligible.
The pitch moment magnitudes,
upper and lower quadrotors as functions of vehicle separations
(x, z) are shown in Figs. 5c and 6c. Both quadrotors
begin to experience a pitch moment when their centerlines are
horizontally displaced. This effect grows until they reach a hor-
izontal separation of xl  2. At this specific configuration,
the upper quadrotors downwash is partially offset, with its left
rotors aligned with the lower quadrotors right rotors, as shown
in the offset configuration (case II) in Fig. 2. This specific
configuration results in the largest moment arm, maximizing
the pitch moment based on the definition of moments as
the product of force and its perpendicular distance from the
pivot location. However, the non-interacting rotors operate in
less a disturbed airflow, partially preserving vehicle thrust,
resulting in lesser overall thrust reduction as seen in Fig. 6a
for this configuration, compared to the stacked configuration in
Fig. 2 (case I), where downwash from the upper quadrotor is
concentrated directly on all four rotors of the lower quadrotor
uniformly. The upper quadrotor experiences a minimal change
in pitch momentonly one-third of that observed by the lower

displacement. The unsteady moments peak at xl  2 before
decaying again, becoming negligible by xl 4. For
vertical separations zl > 16, the flow becomes established,
leading to a steady presence. Similar to force fluctuations, it
can be observed that the moment fluctuations are about two
orders of magnitude smaller for the upper quadrotor compared
to the lower quadrotor (cf. Figs. 5d and 6d). This can be
attributed to the intensity of downwash and the turbulent
fluctuations associated with it, which primarily act on the
lower quadrotor.

component along the x-axis is denoted as v, while the axial
velocity component along the z-axis is denoted as u, based on
the orientation shown in Fig. 3. Note that u is positive, pointing
toward the ground. The resultant velocity fields are averaged
over 1000 frames - (u, v) - to analyze the spatial structure of
the flow fields, including jet merging and spreading patterns.
For single-vehicle flow fields, both axial and lateral velocity
components are presented for a comprehensive understanding
of flow dynamics. However, for the multi-vehicle cases, we
focus on the downwash speed, U ( U
u2  v2), which
captures the contributions from both axial and lateral compo-
Velocities are normalized by the induced velocity, Ui, which
estimates downward airflow generated by the rotor blades
of a propeller as they produce lift according to the actuator
disk theory . While Ui provides a simplified estimate of
the flow directly beneath the propeller and is assumed to be
uniform immediately below the rotor in actuator disk theory, it
does not necessarily represent the actual flow velocity, as the
downwash velocity downstream, U, evolves as a function of
both x and z. Assuming quasi-steady flow based on actuator
disk theory , at the rotor disk, the vehicle thrust, Fz, relates
to the induced velocity, Ui:
where  is the air density, n represents the number of pro-
pellers on the aerial vehicle, and A  r2 is the area swept
by a propeller, where r is the radius of the propeller.
1) Single vehicle near-field flow characteristics: First, we
present the downwash velocity data from a single quadro-
tor. Multiple time-averaged image sequences were stitched
together to form a composite flow field extending over several
rotor diameters below the vehicle, allowing us to characterize
both near-field and far-field flow features with a detailed spa-
tial resolution of 1.6 mm (0.05l). The flows that we observed
are broadly similar to computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
computations of multirotor wakes [9, 32]. The measurements
show similarities to the PIV of time-averaged flow fields of
Carter et al.  and those of flow-probe measurements from
Bauersfeld et al. .
The propellers rotation produces the inflow velocity above
the rotors, generating a suction effect that draws in the
surrounding air. The inflow velocity is roughly one-fifth of the
induced velocity below the rotors and can be noticed above
the left and right propellers of the quadrotor in Fig. 7a. Similar
flow structures have been quantified for modeling the ceiling
effect  and near-field flow analyses [19, 30].
Rotor jets are visible as a high-speed annulus below the
rotor blades and a low-speed core below the rotor hub [8, 19].
The downwash speed and fluctuations in the near-field have
been previously studied . However, here we present an
analysis of the entire flow field. A dead zone exists between
the rotor jets in the near-field immediately below the quadrotor
propellers and the quadrotor bodys presence. This is consis-
tent with CFD simulations [9, 32] and experiments [30, 4].
Figure 7b shows the individual rotor jets merging into a
single jet as we move axially downstream in the centerline
region (xl  0). The transition of individual rotor jets into
a single turbulent jet observed in this study, zl  6.5 (
2.3 motor-to-motor distances), is consistent with Bauersfeld

et al., which reports a similar transition occurring after 2.5
motor-distance length scales . This agreement strengthens
the understanding that quadrotor downwash develops into a
turbulent jet past the near-field region. Beyond this merge
exists at the centerline region, expanding downstream further
along the axial direction into the far-field (zl > 6.5) region.
The time-averaged lateral velocity (v) in Fig. 7c remains
zero at the centerline in both the near- and far-field regions.
Immediately below the rotors, the flow moves inward towards
the vehicle axis, but the polarity of the lateral velocity switches
beyond the merge point and the merged jet starts to spread
Figures 7b and 7d show the axial and lateral velocity
ments of time-averaged downwash flow fields from Figs. 7a
and 7c, respectively, at several values of zl. Axial velocity
profiles maintain symmetry about the centerline (xl  0),
representing two independent rotor wakes that merge to form a
unified jet. The axial velocity increases rapidly at the centerline
and reaches its maximum magnitude as the rotor jets coalesce.
At the merge point, the profiles exhibit a decay in magnitude
while maintaining a self-similar shape and broadening laterally
further downstream into the far-field.
The velocity profile transitions from a highly non-uniform
flow near the rotors, where multiple localized peaks appear due
to individual rotor wakes. In the near field (up to zl 5),
these localized maxima gradually merge into two dominant
peaks (bimodal distribution) by 5 zl 6.5. Eventually,
for zl 6.5, the velocity profile transitions into a shape
dominated by a single peak at the centerline, with a broader
lateral spread and gradually tapering towards the edges.
2) Single vehicle far field flow characteristics - Comparison
with turbulent jet theory: Our experimental far-field flow
measurements are compared with classical turbulent jet the-
momentum source. In this regime, the jet half-width (r 1
quantifies the lateral expansion of the downwash across the

has transitioned to the far-field region (zl > 6.5), where it
behaves as a turbulent jet. The turbulent jet theory establishes
that at any specific downstream location, the lateral position
corresponding to the jet half-width represents precisely where
the axial velocity decreases to half of its centerline maximum
value. This relationship is illustrated by the dashed light blue
lines in Fig. 10. Beyond the merge point, the velocity profiles
transition to a single-peaked distribution as seen for zl > 6.5
in Fig. 7b, and the jet half-width increases linearly with z at
a constant rate, S, as shown in Fig. 8 with the relationship:
where z0 represents the virtual origin determined by tracing
the flow back to where the spread theoretically begins, i.e., a
reference point located above the quadrotor. The black dashed
line in Fig. 8 represents the function form fit for jet half-width
To elucidate jet merging, we consider the axial centerline
(i.e., at xl  0) velocity, uc, and the maximum axial velocity,
Fig. 9: Axial velocity, u in a merged turbulent jet decays linearly with z. Plotted in peach
colors are the centerline velocities (uc) at the axial centerline along each downstream
slice below the rotor plane (zl). The purple symbols show maximum axial velocity

both umax and uc overlap and they collectively decay linearly with z, consistent with
turbulent jets.
and gradually gains magnitude, peaking at half the induced
velocity at zl  6.5, which can be observed in Figs. 7b and
below the rotor plane and stays steady briefly at zl  6.5. At
the merge point (zm), we expect umax and uc to coincide,
which indicates that the individual rotor jets have merged,
with the maximum axial velocity at the axial centerline further
downstream of this unified jet. Figure 9 shows where rotor
jet merging results in an overlap of uc and umax starting
at zl  6.5, beyond which uc and umax are identical in
value and coincide decaying linearly with z, corroborating our
prediction that the individual rotor jets have coalesced. This
is influenced by the velocity profiles attaining a single peak
for zl > 6.5 with radial tapering, the magnitude of which
decays downstream (zl), while spreading over a wider lateral
extent as in Fig. 7b. By definition, the maximum velocity of a
turbulent jet happens at the centerline location , consistent
with our findings (Fig. 9).
The black dashed line in Fig. 9 represents the function form
fit for axial decay of centerline velocity, uc, for a turbulent

where u0 corresponds to the initial jet velocity (set to 1
as in ), B represents an empirical constant tied to the
decay rate, d stands for the exit diameter of the jet, and
z0 indicates the virtual origin defined earlier. Both scaling
analyses for the normalized jet half-width growth (3) and
normalized centerline velocity decay (4) are consistent with
related work ; parameters for each scaling are compared
in Table I. The higher resolution (0.05l) in our measurement
allows for a detailed analysis of the flow field, supported by
a velocity uncertainty of 0.6 mms, derived from a particle
displacement error of 0.2 px per interrogation window at a
sampling rate of 15 Hz.
PIV measurements of the far-field quadrotor wake post-
merge (zl > 6.5) indicate that the velocity profiles attain self-

6.5, where the turbulent
jet achieves full merger, the centerline velocity decreases to
approximately half the induced velocity, with jet half-width
r12 l. The Reynolds number at this location is calcuated
While classical turbulent jet scaling traditionally applies to
high Reynolds number flows (Re 104105), where inertial
forces dominate viscosity, our findings demonstrate that self-
similarity persists even at lower Reynolds numbers (Re
9000) in multirotor-generated downwash. This indicates that
turbulent mixing mechanisms remain dominant despite en-
hanced viscous influencesa critical distinction for quadrotor
Reynolds number regime.
The demonstrated applicability of turbulent jet scaling prin-
ciples at these lower Reynolds numbers provides a robust
theoretical framework for analyzing quadrotor wake interac-
aerodynamic behavior during formation flight in multi-vehicle
systems.
3) Multi-vehicle flow field characteristics: Dense quadrotor
flight necessitates analysis of the flow field interaction between
quadrotors in close proximity. To address this, we analyze
four configurations of multi-vehicle interactions as specified
in Section II-A2.
Figures 12a and 12c shows the flow field for two vertical
12.5), and a small vertical separation z  13 cm (zl  4),
I. These flow field measurements are extracted as axial slices
shown in Figs. 12b and 12d respectively, providing detailed
velocity profiles downstream of the lower quadrotor subjected
to downwash effects.
The vertical separation between the downwash-producing
upper quadrotor and the lower quadrotor influences the lower
neighbors downwash flow field (cf. Fig. 12a and 12c). Larger
vertical separation between upper and lower quadrotor causes
its wake structure to have more distance to spread out and
by the bottom quadrotor in Fig. 12a. Therefore, an increased
vertical separation results in larger magnitudes of velocities
below the lower quadrotor as shown in Fig. 12b. Nevertheless,
the velocities do not appear similar to the ones below a single
quadrotor in Fig. 7a because the lower quadrotor experiences
a net downwash flow component due to the presence of the
upper quadrotor.
Beyond the thrust reduction in the lower quadrotor pre-
viously illustrated in Fig. 6a, close vertical separation also
results in lower velocity magnitudes (cf. Fig. 12b and 12d).
This phenomenon occurs because the lower quadrotor oper-
ates within the upper quadrotors near-field wakea region
characterized by high-velocity, non-uniform flow structures
(visible as multiple high velocity lobes across the x-axis in
Fig. 12c). These complex flow structures directly interfere
with the lower quadrotors ability to generate its own clean
In contrast, far-field regions (6.5 < zl < 10) resemble flatter,
more uniform velocity profiles compared to single quadrotor
flow fields, which had unimodal profiles in the far-field (cf.
Figs. 7b and 12d).
Fig. 13 represents case II in Fig. 2, where the upper quadro-
tor is horizontally offset, resulting in maximum pitch moment
on the lower quadrotor. The lower quadrotor no longer receives
the strongest part of the upper quadrotors wake at its center.
This change in the inflow condition results in an asymmetry
in the lower quadrotors wake seen in Figs. 13a and 13c
at vertical separations of zl  12.5 and zl  4.0,

respectively. This is evident in the velocity profiles that appear
asymmetrical about the axial centerline (cf. Figs. 13b and 13d).
The offset configuration results in less direct wake overlap,
shifting regions of peak velocity off to one side in Figs. 13a
and 13c. This is evident for zl 5, where the peak
velocity magnitude is shifted away from the axial centerline
(cf. Figs. 13b and 13d).
The lateral offset leads to a left-right imbalance that be-
comes more pronounced at shorter vertical separations, re-
sulting in an aerodynamic loading on the lower quadrotor
causing strong wake interaction and merging below the lower
quadrotor as observed in Fig. 13c, whereas for a larger vertical
separation in Fig. 13a, the wake below the lower quadrotor
blends gradually.
C. Dynamic Quadrotor Interactions
Beyond the static separation effects (x, z) analyzed
in Sections II-A1 and II-A2, adjacent vehicles experience
dynamic interactions that vary with the rate of change of
separation (z) as illustrated in Fig. 1 (right). To characterize
these dynamic interactions, we developed a precision linear
dynamic acceleration platform, CrazyRail, shown in Fig. 14,
capable of rapidly accelerating a hovering Crazyflie quadrotor
(C) towards and away from a stationary hovering Crazyflie
quadrotor (D) positioned below. This apparatus enables direct
measurement of the interaction effects that emerge during
dynamic proximity operations. The stationary lower quadrotor
was equipped with an ATI Nano-17 forcetorque transducer,
enabling measurements in both the stacked configuration and
offset configuration (xl  2). Data acquisition mirrored
those established for the static measurement setup detailed in
Section II-A1.

a prescribed sinusoidal trajectory with three key interaction
distance (zmin) between interaction quadrotors, and motion
