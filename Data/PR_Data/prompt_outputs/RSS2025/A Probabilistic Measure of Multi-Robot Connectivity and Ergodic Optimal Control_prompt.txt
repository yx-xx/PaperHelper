AbstractThis paper considers multi-robot trajectory plan-
ning for information gathering with intermittent connectivity
maintenance. For information gathering, ergodic search provides
a framework to inherently balance between exploration (visit
all locations for information) and exploitation (greedily search
high information regions), by planning trajectories such that the
amount of time the robots spend in a region is proportional
to the amount of information in that region. Although ergodic
search was studied in different ways, most of them ignore or
over-simplify the connectivity maintenance requirement among
the robots, which is crucial for information exchange in mis-
sions without global communication. This paper introduces a
novel probabilistic measure of inter-robot connectivity based on
the time-averaged statistics of the robots trajectories. Such a
measure provides a new way to impose intermittent connectivity
constraints during the ergodic search, which leads to an optimal
control problem (OCP). We derive the theoretical condition for
optimality based on the Pontryagin principle, and develop iLQR
and augmented Lagrangian methods to numerically solve this
OCP. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed probabilistic measure and demonstrate that the ergodic
search combined with this measure achieves better ergodic
metrics compared to baseline approaches. We also demonstrate
our planner on a multi-drone system.1
I. INTRODUCTION
This paper investigates a multi-robot trajectory planning
problem for information gathering while maintaining inter-
mittent connectivity among the robots, which arises in ap-
plications such as exploration  and search and rescue .
Given an information map, a probability distribution describ-
ing the information density at each location over the area
to be searched, this paper aims to plan trajectories for the
robots to gather information from this map and establish the
robot-robot connection when needed to exchange information.
Existing approaches for information collection range from
complete coverage [3, 4] that uniformly and systematically
covers the area, to information-theoretic approaches [5, 6] that
greedily direct the robot to the next location with the highest
information gain. Different from them, ergodic search [7
9] provides an approach that can inherently balance between
exploitation (greedily moving to high-information areas) and
exploration (visiting all possible locations). Ergodic search
plans trajectories by minimizing an ergodic metric (ergodicity)

so that the time spent in any region is proportional to a measure
of information in that region.
Although multi-robot ergodic search has been investigated a
lot [1014], most of them either ignores the limited connectiv-
ity among robots [10, 11], assuming all robots are connected
with a central communication hub at all times [12, 13], or
require all robots to stay connected with pre-determined and
fixed connection topology . This paper aims to let the
robots determine flexibly when and where to establish con-
nections during the ergodic search, and thus has the potential
to achieve better ergodicity.
Multi-robot information collection with connectivity main-
tenance has been investigated [1520], and the challenge is
to determine when and where the robots should meet and
what topology of the connection should be formed. In general,
connectivity maintenance and information collection are two
competitive objectives in the sense that maintaining connec-
tivity often lowers the efficiency of information collection,
especially when the information is widely distributed over the
workspace and the robots have to deviate from their optimal
trajectories for information collection to build inter-robot
connections. To balance these two competitive objectives,
instead of maintaining the connection at all times [2124],
requiring intermittent connection with either fixed periods
or computed connection schedules [1820] can help improve
the efficiency of information collection.
The idea of maintaining connectivity during ergodic search
in this paper belongs to the broad category of intermittent
to maintain intermittent connection, such as planning recon-
nection paths , searching for other robots to establish
scheduling discrete connection events [1820], we introduce
a novel probabilistic measure for characterizing inter-robot
connectivity based on the time-averaged statistics of robot
trajectories. The proposed measure attempts to avoid explicitly
formulating the connection locations, times, and topologies as
the planning objective or constraints, or imposing any hard
constraints on connectivity. Instead, this paper seeks to infer
the probability of connection among the robots based on the
distribution of their trajectories as the time horizon goes to
infinity. Such a measure provides a way to impose intermittent
connectivity constraints as soft constraints for trajectory opti-
control problem (OCP) that considers both ergodic search and
connectivity maintenance. To solve this OCP, in theory, we
show how to rewrite this OCP into a standard Bolza form,
and derive the condition for optimality based on the Pontryagin
principle. In practice, we provide an algorithm based on the
augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and iterative linear
quadratic regulator (iLQR) that can numerically solve the OCP.
Our experimental results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed probabilistic measure, as we observe a positive
correlation between the value of the measure and the actual
connection time between the robots along their planned trajec-
tories. Additionally, the results show that the ergodic search
combined with our measure achieves better ergodic metrics
than the baseline approaches, and the robots can intelligently
balance between ergodic search and connectivity maintenance
in the long run. Finally, we showcase the use of our planner
on a multi-drone system in a lab setting.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Ergodic Search
Ergodic search optimizes robot trajectories by minimizing
the difference between the time-averaged statistics of the
robots path and the desired information distribution within
a workspace. To quantify this difference, researchers have
developed various optimization metrics. Among them, spectral
multi-scale coverage (SMC)  employs Fourier decomposi-
tion to measure the difference. Kullback-Leibler (KL) diver-
gence metric  approximates the robots spatial distribution
using a Gaussian mixture model. Kernel ergodic metric
extends ergodic search from Euclidean space to Lie groups in
a computationally efficient way. The ergodic maximum mean
discrepancy metric  samples from the search domain to
define the metric and plan ergodic trajectories.
Gradient-based methods are commonly employed to plan
ergodic trajectories by optimizing the ergodic metric. These
approaches include feedback control laws for both first-order
and second-order dynamics in , receding-horizon ergodic
a potential field , the application of differential dynamic
programming (DDP) , and iterative optimization using
linear quadratic regulator (LQR) .
The scope of ergodic search has recently expanded to
encompass various optimization objectives, including time
efficiency . The practical applications of ergodic control
have also diversified, spanning robotic insertion tasks ,
preserving flows measurement , and real-time area cover-
age and target localization applications [12, 13].
B. Connectivity Maintenance
Connectivity maintenance was extensively studied. Contin-
ual connectivity requires all robots to stay connected at all
times globally [2123] or locally , which is suitable for
communication-critical missions. Periodic connectivity
requires all robots to regain connectivity at pre-defined fixed
intervals. Intermittent connectivity [1820] enables the robots
to meet at some locations intermittently over time without
enforcing a fixed time interval between two subsequent con-
Various approaches have been studied to maintain intermit-
tent connectivity. Some methods focus on selecting connec-
tion times or locations, such as searching other robots for
reconnection paths with minimum travel cost , and de-
termining connection times and locations using integer linear
programming (ILP) . Other work seeks to first determine
the connection schedule and then plan the trajectories based
on the schedules [1820].
This paper aims to maintain intermittent connectivity during
ergodic search. Given these advances in intermittent connec-
tivity maintenance, most existing methods cannot be directly
applied to ergodic search, since many connectivity mainte-
nance approaches involve discrete task planning [25, 34] or
sampling-based methods [17, 18], which are challenging to
integrate with gradient-based trajectory optimization for er-
godic search since the optimization objective (i.e., the ergodic
metric) is defined over the entire trajectory
