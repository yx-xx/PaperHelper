the number of trials is sufficiently large to ensure that the
probability of observing a significant result is at least 0.5. In practice, we
use 100 trials for Nmax up to 500; this is 3x the empirical number of trials in the
final row of Table I. This is a conservative choice to ensure that the
power is sufficiently high in the worst-case null instances.  {
