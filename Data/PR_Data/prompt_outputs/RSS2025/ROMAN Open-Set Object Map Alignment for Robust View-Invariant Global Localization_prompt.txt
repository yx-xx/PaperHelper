AbstractGlobal localization is a fundamental capability re-
quired for long-term and drift-free robot navigation. However,
current methods fail to relocalize when faced with signicantly
different viewpoints. We present ROMAN (Robust Object Map
Alignment Anywhere), a global localization method capable of lo-
calizing in challenging and diverse environments by creating and
aligning maps of open-set and view-invariant objects. ROMAN
formulates and solves a registration problem between object
submaps using a unied graph-theoretic global data association
approach with a novel incorporation of a gravity direction prior
and object shape and semantic similarity. This works open-
set object mapping and information-rich object association al-
gorithm enables global localization, even in instances when maps
are created from robots traveling in opposite directions. Through
a set of challenging global localization experiments in indoor,
that ROMAN achieves higher relative pose estimation accuracy
than other image-based pose estimation methods or segment-
based registration methods. Additionally, we evaluate ROMAN as
a loop closure module in large-scale multi-robot SLAM and show
a 35 improvement in trajectory estimation error compared to
standard SLAM systems using visual features for loop closures.

I. INTRODUCTION
Global localization  refers to the task of localizing a
robot in a reference map produced in a prior mapping session
or by another robot in real-time, i.e., inter-robot loop closures
in collaborative SLAM . It is a cornerstone capability for
drift-free navigation in GPS-denied scenarios. In this paper,
we consider global localization using object- or segment-level
6] to hold great promise in challenging domains that involve
drastic changes in viewpoint, appearance, and lighting.
At the heart of object-level localization is a global data
association problem, which requires nding correspondences
between observed objects and existing ones in the map without
an initial guess. Earlier approaches such as [710] rely on
geometric verication based on RANSAC , which ex-
hibits intractable computational complexity under high outlier
regimes. Recently, graph-theoretic approaches [4, 1216] have
emerged as a powerful alternative that demonstrates superior
accuracy and robustness when solving the correspondence

We use object and segment interchangeably.

problem. In particular, methods based on consistency graphs
[1216] formulate a graph where nodes denote putative object
correspondences and edges denote their geometric consisten-
cies. The data association problem is then solved by extracting
large and densely connected subsets of nodes yielding the
desired set of mutually consistent correspondences. While
segment-based matching has become an established strategy
for loop closures, prior approaches were largely demonstrated
in indoorstructured settings , with limited object varia-
we focus on unseen environments (i.e., we do not make
assumptions about the type of environment in which we
operate), noisy segmentations, extreme viewpoint changes
(Fig. 1), and RGB-D only sensing. Our key claim is that the
proposed work is the only method that performs reliably in
such extreme regimes and clearly outperforms state-of-the-art
segment-based [11, 12, 19] and visual-feature-based [20, 21]
methods in global localization tasks.
Performance in these challenging scenarios is made possible
by extending graph-theoretic data association to use infor-
mation beyond mutual (pairwise) geometric consistency. We
enhance the representational richness of association afnity
metrics by developing a unied formulation that incorporates:
(i) open-set semantics, extracted as semantically meaningful
3D segments [22, 23] with descriptors obtained from vision-
language foundation model, CLIP ; (ii) segment-level
geometric attributes, such as the volume and 3D shapes of
segments that provide additional discriminative power; and
(iii) an additional prior about gravity direction that is readily
available from onboard inertial sensors.
Contributions. We present ROMAN (Robust Object Map
Alignment Anywhere), a robust global localization method in
challenging unseen environments. In detail, ROMAN consists
of the following contributions:
1) A graph-theoretic data association formulation with a
novel method to incorporate segment-level similarities
computed using CLIP descriptors and geometric at-
tributes based on shape and volume. When gravity direc-
tion is known, a gravity-direction prior is also utilized.
Our method implicitly guides the solver to correct 3D
segment-to-segment associations in challenging regimes
when object centroids alone are insufcient for identify-
ing correct associations (e.g., due to repetitive geometric
structures or scenes with few distinct objects)
2) A pipeline for creating open-set 3D segment maps from a
single onboard RGB-D camera, using FastSAM  for
open-set image segmentation and CLIP  for comput-
ing open-set feature descriptors. These maps compactly
summarize the detailed RGB-D point clouds into sparse
and view-invariant representations consisting of segment
locations and metric-semantic attributes, which enable
efcient and robust global localization.

method using real-world datasets (see Fig. 1) that in-
volve urban, off-road, and ground-aerial scenarios. Our
approach improves pose estimation accuracy by 45 in
When using ROMAN rather than visual features for inter-
robot loop closures in multi-robot SLAM, our method
reduces the overall localization error by 8 on large-scale
collaborative SLAM problems involving 6-8 robots and
by 35 on a subset of particularly challenging sequences.
II. RELATED WORKS
Object-based maps are lightweight environment represen-
tations that enable robots to match perceived objects with
previously built object maps using object geometry or se-
mantic labels as cues for object-to-object data association.
Compared to conventional keypoints extracted from visual or
lidar observations, object- or segment-level representations are
more stable against sensor noise and viewpoint, lighting, or
appearance changes, which often cause visual feature-based
methods to fail . Furthermore, these representations are
lightweight and efcient to transmit, an important criterion for
multi-robot systems. In this section, we review related methods
for using object maps for global localization and SLAM.
Object SLAM. To incorporate discrete objects into SLAM,
sparse maps of objects are described with geometric prim-
itives such as points , cuboids  or quadrics .
SLAM  trains domain-specic object detectors for ob-
jects like tables and chairs. Choudhary et al.  use objects as
landmarks for localization, providing a database of discovered
objects. Lin et al.  showed that semantic descriptors can
improve frame-to-frame object data association. Recent works
[6, 31] further leverage open-set semantics from pre-trained
models. Other methods [32, 33] combine the use of coarse
objects for high-level semantic information with ne features
for high accuracy in spatial localization. Object-level mapping
also conveniently handles dynamic parts of an environment
which can be naturally described at an object level [34, 35].
Random sampling for object-based global localization.
Object-level place recognition may be performed by an ini-
tial coarse scene matching procedure (e.g., matching bag-of-
words descriptors for scenes ) but is commonly solved
in conjunction with the object-to-object data association by
attempting to associate objects and accepting localization
estimates when object matches are good [5, 37]. Object-to-
object data association may be solved by sampling potential
rotation and translation pairs between maps  or object
associations [710] using RANSAC . Random sampling
methods often require signicant computation for satisfactory
results and the probability of nding correct inlier associations
diminishes exponentially as the number of outliers grows .
Graph matching for object-based global localization.
accurate alternative for object data association. Objects are
represented as nodes in a graph with graph edges encoding
distance between objects [4, 37, 39]. Data association can be
performed by matching small, local target graphs with the prior
map graph using graph-matching techniques.
Maximal consistency for object-based global localiza-
tion. Different from graph-matching methods, consistency
graph algorithms use nodes to represent potential associations
between two objects in different datasets, and edges to encode
consistency between pairs of associations. Data associations
are found by selecting large subsets of mutually consistent
nodes (associations), which can be formulated as either a
maximum clique [1316] or densest subgraph  problem.
The work by Dube et al.  is one of the early works that
performs global localization by nding maximum cliques of
consistency graphs. Ankenbauer et al.  leverage graph-
theoretic
