, the SDF is computed for each point in the point cloud, which
results in a significant computational overhead. To mitigate this,
we propose to compute the SDF only for the closest point in the
point cloud to the robot surface, as shown in Fig. 13. This
approach reduces the computation time by a factor of 10,000,
making it feasible for real-time applications. However, this
optimization may lead to a slight decrease in obstacle avoidance
performance, as the SDF is not computed for all points in the
point cloud. The trade-off between computational efficiency and
obstacle avoidance performance is an important consideration
for real-world applications. The results in Fig. 13 demonstrate
that the proposed optimization significantly reduces the
computation time while maintaining acceptable obstacle
avoidance behavior.}```
