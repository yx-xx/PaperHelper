# PaperRead
PaperRead is an automated tool for batch-analyzing academic paper PDFs. It automatically reads PDF papers in a designated folder, employs large language models (e.g., GLM-4) to perform structured analysis of their content, and saves the results as an Excel file for easy subsequent organization and retrieval.
