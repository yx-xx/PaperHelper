partial and noisy observations. We present ViTaSCOPE: Visuo-
Tactile Simultaneous Contact and Object Pose Estimation, an

zero-shot transfers to the real-world by bridging the sim-to-real

and real-world experiments, demonstrating its capabilities in
dexterous manipulation scenarios.
I. INTRODUCTION
Dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments re-
quires a seamless interplay of perception and control, par-
ticularly in unstructured settings where visual occlusions and
unpredictable forces are the norm. From grasping a tool to
executing precise interactions with the environment, the ability
to reconstruct an objects geometry, estimate its in-hand pose,
and sense external contacts is critical for enabling effective
manipulation. These capabilities are not merely enhancements;
they are foundational for planning, predicting, and executing
actions. Key to unlocking these capabilities is the ability to
exploit the complementary nature of vision and touch.
lenging due to the inherent ambiguity of partial observations
from vision or tactile sensing alone. Vision offers a global
but often occluded view of the environment, while tactile
sensing provides high-resolution, localized contact information
that complements vision but is limited to regions of intrinsic
contact. Bridging these modalities is essential for integrating
global context with fine-grained contact details, which requires
understanding not only the 3D geometry of objects but also
the behavior of extrinsic contacts that induce shear forces on
tactile sensor membranes.
To address these challenges, we propose ViTaSCOPE: a
unified neural implicit representation for Visuo-Tactile Simul-
taneous extrinsic Contact and in-hand Object Pose Estimation.
ViTaSCOPE introduces a novel framework that integrates vi-
sion and high-resolution tactile feedback to reconstruct object
contacts. Our approach offers the following key contributions:
We propose a contact-aware implicit representation that
encodes object geometry as a signed distance field (SDF)
and registers extrinsic contacts to the 3D geometry by
conditioning on tactile shear field measured by vision-
based tactile sensors. This enables seamless fusion of vision
and tactile observations as an implicit function, enabling
functionalities such as object geometry reconstruction, in-
hand pose estimation, and extrinsic contact localization.
Unlike traditional methods, our representation provides in-
finite resolution for object geometry and tactile shear fields,
unlocking new capabilities for precision manipulation.
ViTaSCOPE offers a modularized approach to integrating
distributed tactile feedback for contact estimation where its
inference process is interpretable.
We scale up the dataset for extrinsic contact estimation
using a penalty-based tactile model in GPU-accelerated
simulation . This approach enables robust sim-to-real
liable performance compared to tactile RGB images.
II. RELATED WORKS
A. Simulation of Vision-based Tactile Sensors
Vision-based tactile sensors such as DIGIT , GelSight
, GelSlim [4, 5], Soft Bubble , and DIGIT360  provide
high-resolution contact information through the observation of
elastometric sensor membrane that deforms upon contact. The
tactile sensors not only provide local texture and geometric
information about the object from its contact patch, but also
contain information about shear and normal force distributions
during contact. These distributions describe pressure, shear,
has been advances in simulating these vision-based tactile
sensors. TACTO  can render realistic high-resolution tactile
signatures as RGB-D images by simulating rigid-body contacts
between the elastomer and a rigid object. TacSL  adopts
the soft contact penalty-based tactile model  with rigid
bodies which allows interpenetration to simulate imaging
process where contact force fields can be computed with GPU-
accelerated Physics in Issac Gym . Taxim  proposes
an example-based method that combines optical simulation
and marker motion field simulation that is calibrated with
contact examples. DiffTactile  introduces a physics-based
differentiable tactile simulation of contact force distribution
and surface deformation using Finite-Element Method-based
soft body model for the elastomers. M3L  uses global vi-
sual image with shear force field images in MuJoCo  with
its touch-grid sensor plugin. In this work, we use TacSL to
simulate shear force field observations from extrinsic contact
events during prehensile manipulation with tools.
B. Implicit Object and Contact Representations
Prior works on dense 3D geometry representations provide
high-fidelity surface reconstructions for complex volumetric
geometries. DeepSDF  introduces a learned continuous
signed distance function (SDF) representation that enables
high-quality shape representation, interpolation, and comple-
tion from partial and noisy 3D input data in canonical pose
of the object. VIRDO [16, 17] extends these concepts by
integrating multimodal feedback from vision and wrench
from forcetorque sensing to learn rich latent embeddings
of contact locations and forces to predict tool deformations
subject to extrinsic contacts. Building on these foundations,
NDCF  jointly models object deformations and extrinsic
contact patches from similarly vision and wrench feedback
using implicit representations, while ensuring that the pre-
dicted contacts lie on the objects surface. NCF  tracks
extrinsic contact by an implicit function that maps a query
point to a contact probability, which does not consider multi-
modal inputs, only vision-based tactile inputs and assumes
physics-informed neural networks to solve inverse source
problems such as identifying unknown source functions for
detecting intrinsic and extrinsic contacts via an implicit rep-
resentation with physics integration.
Despite these advancements, prior approaches [16, 18, 19]
assume rigid grasps or extends the kinematic chain that di-
rectly associate the object pose with the end-effector pose. This
simplification ensures that real-world point cloud observations
align with the objects canonical pose, removing the need for
an additional explicit optimization of object pose in SE(3)
transformation space  before model inference. In contrast,
our work removes the assumption of rigid grasps, allowing for
in-hand object translations and rotations to address real-world
observations in the world frame rather than the canonical pose.
C. Object Shape Reconstruction and Pose Estimation
Accurate object pose estimation is essential for robotics
applications such as manipulation, navigation, and human-
robot interaction. Vision-based methods, coupled with multi-
modal sensing, have significantly advanced the precision and
robustness of 6D pose estimation, particularly in dynamic and
unstructured environments.
Vision-based methods have significantly advanced object
shape reconstruction and pose estimation, leveraging deep
learning and implicit representations. AlignSDF  combines
SDF with parametric models to reconstruct hands and objects
from monocular RGB images, disentangling pose and shape
for improved accuracy. FoundationPose  introduces a
generalizable model for 6D pose estimation across diverse
constructing hand-held objects from single RGB images using
hand articulation as a cue for inferring object shape.
Tactile-based methods [24, 25, 26] achieve pose estimation
from contact RGB image to contact patch estimation then run
matching against a precomputed dense set of simulated contact
patches to do object pose estimation via geometric contact
rendering from virtual cameras in simulation with access to
3D object models.  proposes a model-based approach
where they estimate the contact patches on highly compliant
Soft Bubble sensors  and estimates object pose with ICP
using the obtained tactile pointclouds.  fuses pointclouds
from vision and touch while focusing on the intrinsic contact
geometries. In this paper, we exploit the functionalities of
implicit functions to perform both in-hand pose and extrinsic
contact estimation in a single framework by utilizing both
visuo-tactile point clouds and shear fields.
The integration of vision and touch has further improved 3D
shape reconstruction and pose estimation. [27, 28] demonstrate
how combining these modalities enhances shape reconstruc-
tion quality, with the latter actively selecting tactile readings
for optimal accuracy. Similarly, some works [29, 30] leverage
visuo-tactile data to complete partially observed geometries
and estimate poses robustly under varying conditions. How-
the purpose of 6D pose estimation. In our work, we learn an
implicit representation that can be used for pose estimation
as one of its properties while simultaneously being able to
predict extrinsic contact locations on the object by reasoning
about shear force fields from touch.
Prior works such as SCOPE  and MultiSCOPE
tackle the problem of simultaneous contact and object pose
estimation (SCOPE), which leverages contact particle filters
(CPF) , propriceptive feedback, and forcetorque sensing
to jointly estimate the object pose and the location of contact.
tactile sensing and require a priori known and fixed object
representations. There is currently no way to allow these
methods to learn models online.
D. Extrinsic Contact Estimation and Control
Extrinsic contact sensing is an important yet challenging
problem in contact-rich robotic manipulation due to the oc-
uncertainties in the objects geometry, stiffness, and pose.
Im2Contact  proposes a sim-to-real method that does
not rely on additional sensor modality such as tactile or
forcetorque sensing to achieve zero-shot visual extrinsic con-
tact estimation by using object cropping heuristics around the
EE and optical flow that provides temporal information. An-
other work  leverages active-audio for predicting extrinsic
contacts via visual-auditory feedback zero-shot in the real
world using sim-to-real transfer. [34, 35] both predict contacts
in 2D depth images, which loses key depth information in the
real world. Typically, visual extrinsic contact estimation suffers
from a lack of 3D priors of object geometries and occlusions,
which is often complemented by an additional sensor modality
to capture a more direct contact cues at higher resolution i.e.
audio  or tactile sensing.
Other prior works utilize implicit representations [16, 19,
18] to jointly reason and estimate contact geometries on rigid
and deformable objects. NCF-v2  learns a policy that can
act while sensing and reasoning about extrinsic contacts with
neural contact fields (NCF) but is limited to fixed or known
in-hand poses .
Dexterous regulation and control of extrinsic contacts are
another set of important skills in robotic manipulation. Oller
et al.  decouples the interaction dynamics from the tactile
observation model to control a grasped object for tasks such
as drawing with a pen and pivoting spatulas through extrinsic
contacts.  enables pivoting of an object using a grasped
object with bubble sensors via extrinsic contact mode con-
trol.  proposes an approach to infer the contact location
from tactile shear observations from small motions without
requiring the knowledge of geometry but is limited to fixed
point or line contact modes. [40, 41, 42, 43] uses GelSlim
tactile sensors to sense extrinsic contacts and estimate force
distributions on the sensor membrane for simultaneous tactile
estimation and control for extrinsic dexterity for various tasks
such as insertion. In this paper, we introduce a scalable sim-to-
real method for learning object representations that can reason
about in-hand object poses and tactile cues for perceiving
extrinsic contacts.
III. METHODOLOGY
A. Problem Formulation and Assumptions
We propose ViTaSCOPE, a neural implicit representation
that can fuse complementary visuo-tactile information to rea-
son over in-hand pose of a grasped object and its extrinsic
contact formations from visuo-tactile feedback as outlined in
Fig. 1. The key insight of our method is to jointly predict
the object geometry and the contact geometry on the object
surface while using shear fields observations to characterize
the extrinsic contacts. One challenge with this approach is
being able to collect large scale contact interactions with tactile
shear data and extrinsic contact labels. Therefore, we opt for
training with simulated data and bridging the sim-to-real gap
effectively. Moreover, prior works [16, 18, 19, 36] assumes
known object poses and rigid grasps such that they have access
to the object surface query points in its canonical pose. In this
infer the object pose from visuo-tactile point clouds in the
world frame, which is considered a raw scene observation, to
retrieve the query points in the object canonical pose on which
the neural fields are trained on. We choose to represent the
object geometry, shear, and contact patch as neural fields. By
learning the object geometry and contact patch jointly, we can
enforce physical priors during training and inference, ensuring
that contacts lie on the surface of the object and associate
geometrical information with contact prediction.
Our method is designed to incorporate visuo-tactile feed-
back from RGB-D cameras and vision-based tactile sensors.
We assume access to a partial visual pointcloud Pv RNv3
of the segmented object, tactile pointcloud Pt RNt3 that
form P  { Pt, Pv} together. We also assume access to the
tactile shear vector field  R2 and a tactile grid points on the
sensor membrane g G  {(sx, sy)  sx [sxmin, sxmax] , sx
[symin, symax]}. Then, given a 3D query point q R3, we predict
its SDF value s R and the likelihood that it is in contact
c [0, 1] and for tactile grid 2D query point g R2 we
predict the shear vector field  where its values correspond to

Fig. 3: ViTaSCOPE training and inference. ViTaSCOPE is composed of three modules: Object module O, Tactile module
This representation first enables joint reasoning over visuo-tactile pointcloud observations to perform in-hand pose estimation
using inference via optimization. The tactile module represents the shear vector field in the local coordinates (sx, sy) on a 2D
grid of tactile sensing plane to capture the extrinsic contact configuration conditioned on the in-hand pose z via the latent trial
code z. At inference time, the extrinsic contact trial code is inferred given the observed shear vector field over the grid points
on the distributed left and right tactile sensors. We train the contact module to predict the contact probability c by representing
it as a contact field conditioned on layer-wise activations zO  z0:m of the object module and the tactile trial code z.
The object surface is given as the zero-level set of the signed
distance field, which can be recovered through Marching
Cubes  algorithm or ray tracing methods and can be easily
used to generate a point cloud or a mesh.
The contact patch geometry is given by the intersection of
the object surface with points classified as in contact, where
is the binary classification threshold.
B. Architecture
ViTaSCOPE is designed to infer object geometry, in-hand
observations. To achieve this, we adopt an implicit function-
based approach using auto-decoders to learn geometric, tactile,
and contact representations. The architecture consists of three
core modules (Fig. 3): (i) Object Module (O) whicn rep-
resents the objects 3D geometry as a signed distance field
(SDF); (ii) Tactile Module (T ) which models the tactile
shear field induced by extrinsic contact interactions; and
(iii) Contact Module (C) which estimates the likelihood of
extrinsic contact per query point given object pose, geometry,
and tactile observations.
Object Geometry Representation: We define the objects
shape as a continuous signed distance function (SDF), param-
eterized by a neural network O. Given a query point q R3
in the objects canonical frame, the network predicts its signed
distance s, allowing for reconstruction of the objects surface:
This formulation enables a compact, high-resolution repre-
sentation of object geometry without requiring explicit mesh
storage [15, 16, 18].
Tactile Shear Field Representation: To model extrinsic con-
tact interactions, we introduce a tactile shear field represented
as an implicit function. The Tactile Module (T ) takes as input
a 2D query point g R2 on the tactile sensors sensing plane
and predicts the local shear displacement field:
where  is a latent representation of the in-hand pose and
is a trial code characterizing the contact configuration. T is
conditioned on both the in-hand pose and the trial codes as
the same extrinsic contact interaction at varying in-hand object
poses can induce different shear feedback. The trial code is
learned during training and optimized at inference to explain
the observed shear field. To support reasoning over a set of
distributed tactile sensors, we instantiate a tactile module for
each tactile sensor and concatenate the trial codes from each
sensor along with the in-hand object pose code.
Extrinsic Contact Prediction: Extrinsic contacts are inferred
through the Contact Module (C), which estimates the prob-
ability of contact at a given 3D query point. To incorporate
object geometry, we condition C on the activations from O,
allowing it to use the objects geometric features:
where zO represents the intermediate activations from O. This
formulation ensures that extrinsic contacts are predicted in a
geometry-aware manner, capturing interactions between the
grasped object and the environment.
Unified Implicit Representation: ViTaSCOPE jointly models
object shape, in-hand pose, and contact information within
a single framework (Fig. 3). Unlike traditional methods that
treat pose estimation and contact localization as separate
representations. This allows for: (i) High-resolution geometry
reconstruction without explicit meshes; (ii) Generalization
across different contact interactions by learning latent con-
tact embeddings; and (iii) Seamless integration of visuo-
tactile feedback, enabling robust state estimation.
Each module is parameterized by a neural network, whose
specific architectural implementation details and hyperparam-
eters are provided in Section IV.
C. Training
Training ViTaSCOPE is composed of two stages. The object
module O is first pre-trained to learn the object geometry
without shear field or contact predictions. Then, the object
module is combined with other tactile and contact modules
and trained to jointly learn shear and contact fields.
The object module O is trained to fit the implicit function
to our object shape. We sample off-, near-, and on-surface
query points qi with signed distance si and surface normal
ni labels from the object mesh in its normalized canonical
pose that fits into a unit sphere. Given this dataset of query
samples i  {qj, sj, nj}i of an object, we pretrain O with
the following SDF loss.
O(qj) sj   1
(1 O(qj), n
where s is a subset of sampled surface points and  balances
the loss weights from the SDF error and the normal alignment
error. By learning an implicit function of SDF, the predicted
surface normal can be computed by differentiating the SDF
output w.r.t qj as O(qj)  O(qj)qj via backpropaga-
tion. The object module weights are frozen after pretraining.
To train the entire model, we collect a dataset of con-
tact interactions D

D. Inference
At inference time, our model has access to a partial visual
pointcloud and a tactile pointcloud from left and right tactile
sensors in the world frame as well as the shear displacement
field obtained via tracking the markers from vision-based
tactile sensing. We first perform inference to find the object
pose. Then, we infer the trial code based on shear field
observations to predict contact registered to the 3D geometry
of the object.
Pose Estimation: The visual observation wqvisual
and tactile
observation wqtactile
form the input surface query points wqo
in the world frame. We first initialize the in-hand SE(3)
object pose as the SE(2) constrained pose of the end-effector
parameterized by (x, z, ).
SE(2)  wXee  ProjSE(2)([wXee]1
where s  {qvs, qts R3}, wXo SE(2), and ProjSE(2)
projects the result of its argument (an element in SE(3)) to
SE(2). To compute the object pose, we minimize the following
surface signed distance loss through the object module where
the losses from vision and touch are equally weighted due to
the stochastic nature of the inference process:
S  [wXo]1  wqo
where S is a scale factor for normalizing the geometries into
a unit sphere.
We use gradient descent through our model to minimize
the loss. This method is often referred to as inference via
optimization [17, 18] since the variable of interest is derived
through the optimization program.
Extrinsic Contact Trial Code Inference: Next, we optimize
the trial code  in the same manner as pose estimation such
that our tactile module T matches the observed shear field. We
run inference via optimization in Eq. 13. Our key insight is that
shear fields can capture rich information about the extrinsic
contact interaction through the force transmission, subject to
in-hand object pose . By optimizing for the trial code that
can best explain the observed shear field induced by extrinsic
contacts per object geometry and the in-hand pose, we can
extract meaningful information about the contact configuration
as a latent code .
T (gj  , ) [uj, vj]
where [uj, vj]is the observed shear field.
Contact Prediction: Once the trial code is inferred, we run
inference on the full model to predict the contact probability
for each query points on the object surface. This is equivalent
to evaluating our model at surface query points and reading
the value of the contact field. The contact patch geometry can
be retrieved as the intersection of points that are above the
contact threshold and belong to the surface of the object as in
IV. IMPLEMENTATION
A. Model
The tactile module T and contact module C are imple-
mented as hypernetworks, where conditioning latent codes are
employed to predict the weights of a secondary network. We
instantiate two tactile modules corresponding to the distributed
left and right tactile sensors. This network then processes
the query point and outputs the corresponding field value,
aligning with recent advancements in neural implicit methods
that emphasize hypernetworks as the optimal approach for
conditioning outputs [17, 18].
[u, v]T  T (g  HT (, ))
c  C(q zO, T (g  , )  HC(, ))
The hypernetworks HO, HT , and HC predict the weights of
the MLP of each module. We regularize the predicted weights
as the following. The MLP of O, T , and C are implemented
with two hidden layers of size 256. We set the latent code
size of pose  as 3 for the SE(2) in-hand object pose (x, z, )
and extrinsic contact  as 12 (left and right tactile sensors
concatenated).

hyper is a weighting on the regularization loss.
B. Training and Inference Details
ViTaSCOPE training is split into two stages. First, the
object module is pretrained for 50000 epochs using the Adam
optimizer with the learning rate of 1e 5 and a normal loss
weighting of normal of 0.01. Then, with the frozen weights
of the object module, ViTaSCOPE is trained using the Adam
optimizer with the learning rate of 1e 5. The latent codes
are initialized from the zero mean Gaussian with the standard
deviation of 0.1. We use shear  0.1, embedding  0.2,
hyper  25.0 and contact  2.0 and train for 20 epochs.
ViTaSCOPE inference for in-hand pose estimation uses the
Adam optimizer with the learning rate of 5e3 and a learning
rate scheduler with a minimum learning rate of 1e 4. The
SE(2) in-hand pose estimate is initialized at the SE(2) EE
pose that is projected onto the x-z plane of the EE frame.
Once an estimate of the in-hand pose is obtained, we infer the
extrinsic contact trial code using the Adam optimizer with the
learning rate of 3e2. We initialize the in-hand pose estimate
as the EE pose to accelerate the inference process.
C. Data Generation
requires various multi-sensory data which can be challenging
to collect at scale in the real world. To address this, we instead
propose a sim-to-real approach where we leverage simulation

to generate data to train the three modules (O, T , C). Once
on downstream in-hand pose estimation and extrinsic contact
prediction tasks.
Training the Object Module O requires a 3D mesh model of
the object, which is first zero-centered and scaled by a factor
S to fit the mesh into a unit sphere (r  1). We sample 5000
off-surface query points, 15000 on-surface query points, and
20000 near-surface query points on this normalized mesh in its
canonical pose paired with ground truth signed distance and
surface normals. We denote this as the object-centric canonical
frame or pose, where the object module takes in query points
defined in this object canonical frame. In this paper, we 3D
print 6 tool geometries with varying tool-tip complexity as
shown in Fig. 4 for training and testing. We assume access to
the mesh models of these geometries for training purposes.
Fig. 4 also visualizes sample meshes generated using the
pretrained object module.
We use Isaac Gym  coupled with TacSLs  vision-
based tactile sensing simulation capabilities to generate a large
dataset of contact locations, object poses, and visuo-tactile
feedback. We split this dataset into training and test sets for
training and inference. Fig. 5 visualizes 6 sample scenes for
each tool and a sampled contact interaction. We place eight
cameras spaced evenly around the EE pose during contact
to capture the partial point clouds of the target tool object.
Using TacSLs implementation of the penalty-based tactile
The simulation data generation pipeline works as follows:
R1.5 vision-based tactile sensors on the grippers to grasp the
tool at randomized pitch angle of the EE. Next, the robot lifts
the object and pushes down on to the table at a random angle
as visualized in Fig. 5. This effectively generates diverse grasp
poses of the tool and varying contact modes on the tool surface
to induce a diverse distribution of tactile feedback.
The Tactile Module T learns to predict a field of shear
displacements. We first generate a uniform 2D grid of tactile
points of shape [30, 20] with [sxmin, sxmax]  [0.008, 0.008]
and [symin, symax]  [0.01215, 0.01215], which is scaled and
normalized to fit into a square grid of length 1. For TacSL
This effectively maps each 2D query point to its corresponding
shear displacement vectors from simulation. These shear vec-
tors are normalized to unit vectors for those above a magnitude
threshold of 1e 8 to mitigate numerical instabilities and
to bridge the sim-to-real gap caused by mismatches between
simulated and real-world shear vectors.
As Isaac Gym does not allow the users to access the contact
locations directly, we replicate the scene in open3d and
estimate the contact location by thresholding on object-table
For each contact scene, we collect 1000 contact points to
train the Contact Module C. At training time, we normalize
the individual shear displacement vectors and augment it by
adding random Gaussian noises N(0, 0.1) along the local
(sx, sy) tactile frames to account for real-world noises and the
sim-to-real gap of the gel elastomer deformation dynamics of
the tactile sensor.
For each tool contact simulation, we sample 500 contact
interactions per tool, resulting in 3000 in total for six tools.
For the simulated testing data, we generate 50 interactions per
Real World: We outline the pipeline for collecting the
real-world test data that takes an equivalent form of the
simulated data. For the purpose of evaluation, we collect the
scene observations and ground truth object poses. For the
real world setup, we use the 7DoF Franka Emika Panda arm
with a pair of Gelslim 4.0 vision-based tactile sensors. We
set up a single front view Realsense D435 RGB-D camera
with known extrinsics to obtain the scene point clouds in
the world frame. We attach AprilTags to the tool geometries
to track the object poses. Segmented tool point clouds are
obtained by using Grounded SAM v2  open-vocabulary
segmentation model. For the tactile point cloud, contact patch
points on the sensor membrane is de-projected into the 3D
scene. Given this perception pipeline, we command a similar
robot motion as in simulation to collect various extrinsic
contact interactions at randomized angles and in-hand pose.
We collect 10 interactions per geometry, resulting in 60 trials
of real world test data.

on synthetic point clouds sampled from object meshes at
known poses, rather than real visual input and has only been
evaluated in sim . However, ViTaSCOPE eliminates
these assumptions by handling unknown object poses and
fusing real-world vision and touch. Therefore, we run our
pose estimation to provide NCF with the object pose to
sample a point cloud from the object mesh model as their
input as we do not assume fixed in-hand pose. We trained the
full NCF model for each geometry by first training the NDF
occupancy field, fine-tuning the tactile RGB autoencoder,
and the sequence-to-sequence tactile autoencoder.

points. The mean CD of 0.052 m2 from Tab. I suggest that
model is able to reconstruct the geometry of all grasped objects
accurately.
In-hand Pose Estimation: We evaluate the in-hand object
pose estimates using Mean Squared Error (MSE) in translation
(mm) and angular distance (degrees) compared to ground
truth object pose in Tab. II. The results suggest that our
model is able to accurately localize the object despite its
partial view of the object. The insight is that tactile sensing
provides key contextual cues that can significantly improve
pose estimation. The ablation study in Tab. II points out how
vision can drive the global alignment of a pose estimate while
touch provides dense local points with lower uncertainty as the
points lie on the intrinsic contact surface. It can be seen how
tactile-only pose estimation can be inherently ambiguous while
complementary visuo-tactile pose estimation can refine the
pose to improve the accuracy even further. To provide context,
the average object is 90 mm, thus the error is in the order of
a 2 to 4 of the object length. The ground truth pose in the
real-world is collected using AprilTags which themselves have
approximately 1 mm error in our setup. It is also important
to note the relative similarity in estimates across simulation
and the real-world, suggesting the models ability to effectively
bridge the sim-to-real gap as it operates on point clouds. In
the open3d implementation of the ICP baseline, the algorithm
takes in a segmented point cloud of the object mesh (SDF
reconstructed mesh in this case) and the ground truth visuo-
tactile point cloud. We emphasize that the comparison is not
exactly fair as our model does not have access to the ground
truth geometry, instead it approximates it. Despite this, our
model outperforms ICP as shown in Tab. II. This table shows
how vision or touch alone can introduce ambiguity in object
pose whereas when combined the performance becomes more
Extrinsic Contact Estimation: We evaluate the extrinsic
contact patch using the Chamfer Distance, which is based
on normalized geometries. Extrinsic contact estimation is
particularly challenging as it often is heavily occluded by
the object and potentially the robot itself. Extrinsic contact
is also fundamentally ambiguous given purely tactile or force
ViTaSCOPE accurately predicts extrinsic contact patches, even
under challenging occlusions. The contact localization error
remains low, with Chamfer Distances comparable between
simulation and real-world trials. We note that Isaac Gym does
not provide contact locations or wrench and we use mesh
and its poses to extract samples of contact points, which
uses soft contact thresholding using SDF. Our model learns
a better approximation to the contact patch that is closer to
realistic contacts than the ground truth soft contact labels
as shown in Fig. 6. The observed discrepancies in CD arise
from soft-contact thresholding between two rigid-body SDFs
for generating contact patch labels. However, this results in
exaggerated CD values for rectangles and cylinders, which
have large ground truth contact patches on large flat surfaces
despite ViTaSCOPEs more realistic predictions aligned with
rigid-body contacts. With the NCF baseline, we noticed a
significant drop in performance during sim-to-real transfer. We
attribute this to its sensitivity to pose estimation errors and
limited ability to interpret tactile feedback that varies with

geometries on the real world test data are shown. The predicted contact patches are represented with the red pointclouds and
the ground truth contact patches are in green. The values below each mesh are the CD between the predicted and ground truth
contact patches on normalized geometries. ViTaSCOPEs contact predictions are more realistic than the ground truth contact
patches obtained via soft contact SDF thresholding (i.e. most rigid-body contacts are point or line). Geometries such as the
rectangle and cylinder allows for large contact patches, which tends to result in a higher CD.

RGB images. In the following Section V-C, we discuss how
our experiments suggest that the tactile shear representations
can be more effective for extrinsic contact detection and sim-
to-real transfer.

pose improves downstream contact prediction by evaluating
ViTaSCOPE trained without intermediate activations from the
object module (denoted as wo acts) and without object pose
(denoted as wo obj pose). The results support our claim that
coarse-to-fine geometrical understanding through the activa-
tions and being aware of the in-hand pose is crucial for
inferring contact patches from visuo-tactile feedback.
Effect of Tactile Shear Representation: We assess whether
the tactile shear representation is suitable for capturing di-
verse contact modesparticularly in the context of sim-to-
real transferby replacing the shear field tactile module with
an RGB-based one (shear rgb). Training this model using
tactile RGB images from our simulation dataset results in a
performance drop despite using example-based (i.e. uses real
sensors background image) realistic RGB tactile simulation
[1,11]. This is likely due to its inability to capture intricate and
subtle extrinsic contact cues compared to shear representation,
which enables cross-sensory generalization (GelSight in sim
to GelSlim in real) and sim-to-real transfer.
Effect of In-Hand Pose Accuracy on Contact Prediction:
In Tab. II shows that the pose accuracy degrades when using
vision-only (denoted as V pcd) or tactile-only (denoted as T
pcd) point clouds. We extend this analysis to assess the impact
on downstream extrinsic contact prediction (Tab. III). Running
inference on vision-only pose estimate (V pcd), despite being
slightly less accurate, performs comparably to the visuo-tactile
vitascope model, demonstrating ViTaSCOPEs robustness to
moderate pose errors. In contrast, running inference with
tactile-only pose estimate (T pcd) yields performance similar
to the model without object pose (wo obj pose), underscoring
the critical role of complementary visuo-tactile feedback for
accurate pose estimation and effective contact prediction.
Inference Time and Generalizability: We outline the com-
putational time of our two-stage inference (Pose Est.  Trial
Code Inf.) and the number of gradient steps per optimization
and forward pass (Contact Pred.) in Tab. IV. Our model
runs at 0.3Hz, with faster inference possible by reducing
optimization steps or tuning the optimizer, at some cost to
accuracy. To demonstrate ViTaSCOPEs ability to handle more
complex geometries, we generated simulation data and trained
it on Stanford bunny and show a real-world prediction in
Fig. 7. For generalization to unseen objects, we can use object
codes via hyper-networks trained on large-scale object sets, as
in DeepSDF . Open-vocabulary detectors can jumpstart
object code inference.
VI. DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS
pose estimation and extrinsic contact localization, leveraging
implicit representations to seamlessly integrate visuo-tactile
feedback. Our results demonstrate that tactile shear fields offer
rich information for estimating contact distributions and, when
combined with visual input, can provide robust geometric
reasoning for manipulation tasks. Notably, our approach gener-
alizes across different tool geometries and contact interactions.
As expected, we observe experimentally that vision and
touch provide complementary information that enhances both
global spatial reasoning and local contact understanding. Vi-
sion provides a broad, albeit often occluded, view of the scene,
while tactile sensing offers high-resolution measurements of

sibility of training contact-aware models in simulation while
preserving their effectiveness in real-world manipulation tasks.
Our method relies on accurate shear field measurements from
vision-based tactile sensors. However, sensor noise, lighting
Lack of Normal Force Information. We currently focus on
shear fields and do not explicitly model normal forces, which
are crucial for capturing contact pressures and forces per-
pendicular to the surface. Future extensions could incorporate
normal force estimation to improve contact modeling.
Handling of Complex Contact Interactions. While Vi-
TaSCOPE can generalize across different geometries, certain
ambiguous contact configurations (e.g., multiple small contact
patches producing similar shear responses) remain difficult
to disambiguate. This ambiguity is likely fundamental and
unlikely to be overcome with conventional tactile sensing
technologies.
In-Hand Slippage and Deformation. Gel-based tactile sen-
sors introduce compliance, meaning object pose may shift
subtly during contact interactions. Here, we do not address
the possibility of slippage between the robot and object.
Scaling to More General Objects. Our framework assumes
that object geometries are known at training time. Generalizing
to previously unseen objects without requiring explicit mesh
models is an important direction for future work.
Extending to Dexterous Hands. Extending ViTaSCOPE to
a dexterous multi-fingered hand with our distributed tactile
module would be an interesting direction to take.
