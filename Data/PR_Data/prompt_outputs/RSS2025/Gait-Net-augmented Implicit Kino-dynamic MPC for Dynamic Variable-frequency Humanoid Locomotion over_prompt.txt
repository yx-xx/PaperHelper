AbstractReduced-order-based optimal control techniques for
humanoid locomotion struggle to adapt step duration and place-
ment simultaneously in dynamic walking gaits due to their
reliance on fixed-time discretization, which limits responsiveness
to various disturbances and results in suboptimal performance
in challenging conditions. In this work, we propose a Gait-
Net-augmented implicit kino-dynamic model-predictive control
(MPC) to simultaneously optimize step location, step duration,
and contact forces for natural variable-frequency locomotion. The
proposed method incorporates a Gait-Net-augmented Sequential
Convex MPC algorithm to solve multi-linearly constrained vari-
ables by iterative quadratic programs. At its core, a lightweight
Gait-frequency Network (Gait-Net) determines the preferred step
duration in terms of variable MPC sampling times, simplifying
step duration optimization to the parameter level. Additionally, it
enhances and updates the spatial reference trajectory within each
sequential iteration by incorporating local solutions, allowing the
projection of kinematic constraints to the design of reference
trajectories. We validate the proposed algorithm in high-fidelity
simulations and on small-size humanoid hardware, demonstrat-
ing its capability for variable-frequency and 3-D discrete terrain
locomotion with only a one-step preview of terrain data.
I. INTRODUCTION
Contactfootstep planning is a fundamental problem in hu-
manoid robot motion control. Due to the inherent instability
of these robots, efficient integration of both contact planning
and motion control is an essential step to enable dynamic and
robust locomotion across diverse terrains.
A. Contact Planning
Footstep planning has traditionally been treated as a high-
ecution [1, 2, 3, 4]. For instance, Deits and Tedrake  ad-
dresses 3D humanoid footstep planning using a highly efficient
mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic program
(MIQCQP) to compute trajectories in seconds. In addition,
Bouyarmane and Kheddar  proposes a best-first algorithm
for collision-free multi-contact planning in humanoid loco-
manipulation. However, these offline trajectories, tracked by
whole-body control or inverse-kinematics-based controllers,
often suffer from error accumulation over long trajectories due
to their open-loop nature.
Contact-implicit model-predictive control (CI-MPC) has
gained popularity for optimizing contact force, location, and
timing within a unified framework by addressing the linear

complementarity problem (LCP) between contact velocity and
force [5, 6, 7]. These frameworks integrate contact planning
and motion control to generate optimal contact behaviors in
real-time. However, CI-MPC involves solving highly complex,
nonlinear problems with significant computational demands.
While Le Cleach et al.  precompute LCP parameters offline
to improve online speed, this process remains costly and must
be repeated for each new setup.
B. Humanoid Locomotion with Simplified Models
Convex MPC (CMPC) is widely used in legged locomotion
as single rigid-body model (SRBM) , for fast and high-
frequency control by optimizing ground reaction forces. How-
linearization. Foot placement is typically determined sepa-
rately using heuristics (e.g., Raibert heuristic ), capture
point methods , or optimizations with the linear inverted
pendulum model . These approaches embed predefined
step durations (a.k.a., one-step gait duration), making it chal-
lenging to invert the problem and determine duration from
foot location, especially in 3-D. Feed-forward step duration
is also suboptimal for adaptive strategies on uneven terrain,
where step duration should highly correlate with stride length
and current foot actuation.
Centroidal dynamics (CD) is widely used in humanoid
robot control for its simplified yet effective representation
of whole-body dynamics, making it suitable for real-time
planning and control . CD-MPC and kino-dynamic MPC
are often formulated as nonlinear MPC (NMPC) problems
[14, 15, 16]. Garca et al.  leverages CMPC formulation
and CD-augmented SRBM to include link inertia. However,
the framework still requires predefined gait schedules and the
generation of footstep locations from separate modules. Ad-
MPC by explicitly optimizing joint states, ensuring feasible
whole-body motions . In contrast, CD-MPC lacks kine-
matic coupling between foot location and floating base states,
often necessitating lower-level inverse kinematics (IK) motion
generation  or whole-body control . In our work,
the implicit kino-dynamic MPC aids kinematic assurance and
eliminates the need to optimize joint states.
C. Challenges in Variable Frequency Locomotion
Variable gait frequency locomotion remains under-explored
in humanoid robotics. Previous works have primarily ad-
dressed this problem at the footstep planning level [21, 22,
the MIT humanoid robot demonstrates impressive performance
with whole-body MPC , its gait frequency is fixed and
determined by the MPC sampling time. Li and Nguyen
optimize gait frequency offline for stepping stone terrain, but
the open-loop approach lacks real-time adjustments based
on state feedback. In contrast, our work enables variable-
frequency bipedal walking by concurrently optimizing foot
step planning together in one optimization.
Gait frequency can be integrated into the MPC framework
by optimizing the sampling time per step with a fixed contact
schedule. However, this introduces a multi-linear coupling of
foot location, contact force, and sampling time, significantly
increasing problem complexity and solving time. To address
sequential QP (SQP) solver that efficiently handles these multi-
linear terms through iteratively solving QP problems.
D. Learning-augmented Optimization-based Control
Learning-based control methods, such as reinforcement
learning (RL), have achieved significant success in legged
locomotion [27, 28, 29, 30]. For example, Wang et al.
demonstrated natural locomotion over discrete stepping-stone
terrains. However, the terrain configurations were limited to
segments encountered during the second stage of training.
On the other hand, model-based approaches have also gained
from learning-based techniques [32, 33, 34, 35]. For example,
pre-trained neural networks (NN) can approximate complex,
computationally intensive nonlinear functions, as shown in
, where an NN predicts centroidal inertia evolution, elim-
inating the need for complex spatial momentum computations
in optimization. In this work, we address the weak correlation
between gait frequency and foot location, an inherent limita-
tion of simplified dynamics models such as SRBM and CD,
by introducing Gait-Net, an NN that is trained on data from
variable-gait-frequency MPC with whole-body dynamics.
E. Contributions
The main contributions are twofold. Firstly, we propose
a novel Gait-Net-augmented Implicit Kino-dynamic MPC
framework that concurrently optimizes foot contact force,
foot location, and footstep duration. In this framework, we
introduce supervised learning in a sequential CMPC algorithm
to efficiently solve NMPC with multi-linear constraints.

each sequential MPC iteration, Gait-Net (1) determines the
preferred step duration in terms of MPC sampling time dt,
transforming dt from a decision variable to a parameter for
efficiency; and (2) improves the estimation of reference spatial
momentum and pose trajectories to mimic more closely as
an explicit kino-dynamic approach while eliminating the joint
angles as part of state variables.

In this section, we present the control system architecture
of the proposed framework, shown in Fig. 2. Empirically,
humanoid kino-dynamics MPC explicitly optimizes the joint
states through kinematics constraints , while traditional

Net-augmented sequential CMPC algorithm that translates the
original nonlinear problem into convex sequential subprob-
lems. With the additional assistance of Gait-Net, we reduce

joint-space trajectories, along with joint-space feedback states,
are then translated into spatial momenta h R6 and their
variables used in the Gait-Net-augmented kino-dynamic MPC.
Within the MPC, we break down the nonlinear dynamics
constraints into sequential CMPC subproblems that can be
solved through QP solvers. In each sequential iteration j,
the Gait-Net predicts and updates the MPC sampling time dt
towards convergence and enables variable-frequency walking.
The spatial momentum and pose trajectories are updated at
each iteration to reflect the kinematic configuration based on
the iterative solution of dt, CoM location pc R3, and
foot locations pf R3ni, providing a kinematically feasible
reference. Once the terminal condition is met in the custom
sequential solver, the control inputs are then mapped to motor
commands in low-level control, which incorporates standard
techniques such as inverse kinematics, contact Jacobian map-
Net-augmented Kino-dynamic MPC is run at the beginning
of each footstep to determine the step duration, the rest of
the duration will incorporate the kino-dynamic MPC with the
same MPC dt throughout this very footstep.
III. PRELIMINARY
In this section, we introduce the background of the whole-
body MPC used during the variable-frequency walking data
collection process and a general explicit kino-dynamics MPC
formulation for humanoid robots.
A. Whole-body Model Predictive Control
Driven by the strong dynamics and kinematics correlation
between the footstep location, duration, and whole-body coor-
dination with Whole-body MPC on humanoid robots [25, 18],
we leverage such a control paradigm to obtain high-fidelity
humanoid locomotion results in simulation to serve as the
training dataset for Gait-Net. We particularly focus on adapting
this MPC to achieve variable MPC sampling times for each
footstep (i.e., variable-frequency walking). Notably, to achieve
variable-frequency walking, we fix a periodic contact sequence
of the locomotion to be every h MPC time-steps. Therefore,
we can allow variable step durations at each footstep by
adjusting the sampling time dtk of every h  h2 time-steps,
as a one-step gait duration.

Equation (2) refers to the objective function of the NMPC,

The optimization problem is also subjected to additional
equality (3b) and inequality (3c) constraints. These constraints
include general constraints to ensure humanoid locomotion,
such as friction pyramid constraints, torque limits, joint limits,
contact wrench saturation, and contact wrench cone (CWC)
constraints . The joint torque result from optimization can
be directly applied as the motor command to control the robot.
direct impact on the control performance (i.e., a higher hyper-
sample rate will benefit faster reaction to disturbances).
B. Explicit Kino-dynamic Model Predictive Control
Due to the heavy computation burden of the full-order
dynamics model in whole-body MPC, many works that lever-
age this control method trade-off solution accuracy for high-
frequency online deployment, such as constraining the number
of iterations in SQP solvers [25, 38] and leveraging Dif-
ferential Dynamic Programming (DDP) . According to
, the performance of such whole-body MPCs is still to
be proven to outperform the relatively more computation-
friendly Centroidal-dynamics MPC (CD-MPC) and Kino-
dynamics MPC (full kinematics  CD) [14, 17, 40, 41]. Hence,
a well-constructed Kino-dynamics MPC can very well stand
at the middle ground of computation intensity and control
performance for online deployment.
The centroidal dynamics of a humanoid robot is:

where lG R3 and kG R3 are the rate of change of linear
momentum and angular momentum. (pf,ipc) is the distance
vector from the ith contact point pf,i to robot CoM pc.

Hence the optimization variables of the explicit kino-

The finite horizon optimization problem with a prediction of

where the objective function (8) aims to track a predefined
spatial momentum trajectory, state variable trajectory, and
minimize ground reaction wrenches. The dynamics f kd in (9a)
is the discrete-time dynamics of (5-6). Additional constraints
(9b-9c) are similar to those of whole-body MPC.
It is worth noting that the kinematics aspect of the kino-
dynamics MPC is computationally burdensome due to the
direct optimization of full joint states. However, it may be
embedded in the design of the MPC. As shown in , a CD-
MPC chooses the spatial momentum vector and float-based
states as the MPC states. This approach requires a somewhat
accurate approximation of the evolution of the joint angles
within the prediction horizon to construct meaningful spatial
momentum trajectories. Hence,
Assumption 1: If the actual spatial momentum and pose
evolution closely align with the designed trajectories, kine-
matic assurance can be implicitly embedded into the reference
trajectory design rather than explicitly included in constraints.
This enables an implicit kino-dynamic MPC approach.
In contrast, in BiConMP , the kinematic feasibility is
guaranteed by a subsequent kinematics optimization after the
MPC finds a feasible spatial momentum trajectory. In our
sequential CMPC subproblem and actively update the spatial
reference based on the newly updated foot locations and float-
based states within sequential iterations. We will discuss this
key method in Sec. IV-B.

IV. PROPOSED APPROACH
In this section, we introduce the proposed approaches in
this work, including the Gait-frequency Network, the Gait-
Net-augmented kino-dynamics MPC formulation, and the se-
quential MPC solving mechanism.
A. Gait-frequency Network
Instead of relying on heuristics or solving an additional
optimization problem to determine step frequency from the
desired foot location, we propose a lightweight Gait-frequency
Network that maps current state feedback and desired foot
placement to the preferred step duration for the upcoming
co-optimizing the target variables. An illustration of the Gait-
Net is shown in Fig. 3.
1) Data collection: We begin by using a whole-body MPC
as our baseline controller to collect variable-frequency walking
data. Besides a more accurate representation of kinematics
and dynamics of the robot model, this approach is chosen
for two key reasons: first, whole-body MPC outperforms
other simplified-model-based control methods under strong
unknown disturbances . Second, we utilize a MATLAB-
based high-fidelity simulation framework, bypassing real-time
hardware constraints. This enables the use of a more pre-
cise and robust interior-point-method-based nonlinear pro-
gramming solver at higher control frequencies. The primary
objective of this stage is to gather high-resolution data using
a robust control algorithm under controlled disturbances in
simulation.
We ran 15 different sets of walking simulations that have a
total period of 600 seconds of walking data with a small-size
humanoid model in the simulation. In each set, we command
the robot to walk at a constant velocity in the range of
[0, 1] ms . At the beginning of each stride, we generate a
randomized step duration between [150, 400] ms . In the first
half of the walking simulation, the robot is commanded to
walk without any disturbances, while in the second half, we
apply randomized external impulses to the CoM of the robot
every 2 seconds with the magnitude of [10, 100] N
duration of 0.2 seconds.
Despite the relatively small training dataset, the Gait-Net
and MPC combination effectively handles various scenarios
with predicted step durations, as demonstrated in Sec. V.
2) Latent space feature reduction: The collected data ini-
tially includes the robots floating-base state variables and
world-frame foot locations for both legs (R16). However, not
all featuresstates are equally deterministic in the CoM space to
determine the output of the network. To streamline the feature
space for more efficient inference in each iteration while
maintaining accurate predictions of variable MPC sampling
the input features. Specifically, we select one feature with a
high absolute loading from each of the top six principal axes,
as these features are minimally correlated and capture the most
significant variance in the feature space. Fig. 4 illustrates the
PCA loadings of all features across six principal axes.
B. Gait-Net-augmented Kino-dynamic MPC
1) Motivation: Given a fixed periodic contact sequence
in MPC, one can vary the duration of each swing phase
by altering the MPC sampling time dt for the entire swing
duration of each footstep made up of h MPC time steps.
Hence the swing time t  hdt. To achieve a variable-
frequency walking MPC, we need to optimize the contact
discrete-time CD at time step k,
i0(pf,i pc)  fi  i
Nonlinearity arises from the bilinear and multi-linear terms
formed by the (cross) products of the three optimization
variables.
In this section, we introduce a novel NN-augmented solving
mechanism inspired by the popular SQP approach, allowing
the MPC dt to be concurrently determined by the Gait-Net
alongside the optimization of other variables.
2) Implicit kinematics assurance in trajectory reference:
By selecting spatial momenta h and their primitive H (cen-
troidal pose) as optimization variables, CD-MPC avoids in-
cluding joint angles in the optimization process. However,
generating these spatial reference trajectories still requires a

position trajectory solutions in each iteration, we perform a
fast analytical inverse kinematics (IK) fIK to compute the
corresponding joint trajectories for spatial momenta updates.
The complete analytical IK and the approximation of H are
provided in the Appendix.
Remark 1: The spatial momentum and centroidal pose
reference trajectories are updated in each sequential iteration to
align with foot position updates, implicitly enforcing kinematic
consistency in the reference trajectory.
3) Convex MPC Subproblem: To address the weak corre-
lation between foot location and swing duration in the CD
to predict the MPC sampling time at the beginning of each
step based on the local foot and CoM location solutions at
each sequential iteration. This process continues until the
convergence condition is met. This also translates dt from
the optimization variable space to the parameter space for
computation efficiency.
To linearize the bilinearly constrained dynamics constraint
(10) in the kino-dynamics MPC problem. We take inspiration
from the SQP solving mechanism and solve the search direc-
tion  of the bilinear variables,
i  fi, i   j
where the j superscript denotes the total solution from the
previous sequential iteration j. The dynamics evolution of the
angular momentum can be simplified with the assumption:
Assumption 2: With reasonable warm-startinitialization of
the bilinear variables a0, b0, the bilinear product of the
search directions are minimal and negligible as the sequential
iteration j increases, aj  bj 0, illustrated in Fig. 5.

Remark 2: The linearization w.r.t. search directions  and
with Assumption 2 arrives mathematically identical to 1st-
order Taylor expansion of bilinear constraints with the SQP
algorithm .
a) Optimization Variables: We choose the state variable
to be the spatial momentum vector h and centroidal pose H,
and the control input variables to be the search directions of
ground contact wrench, foot location, and MPC sampling time
over a finite horizon h,
{fi,k, i,k, pf,i,k}ni
b) Objective Function: The linearized finite horizon op-
timization problem can be formulated as
The objectives are to track spatial trajectories, foot reference
ground reaction wrenches. Note that the foot reference is
constructed based on a preferred foot location through Gait-
Net with a nominal MPC dt. This trajectory will be updated
with each sequential iteration j until convergence.
c) Linearized dynamics: With Assumption 2 and search
direction linearization in equation (14-15), we obtain the CD
as a linear form with respect to our choice of control input
and state variables. At time step k, the discrete dynamics is
xk1  Akxk  Bkuk  Ck,
where Ak and Bk are the state space matrices. Ck contains
only the constant terms shown in equation (14-15) in terms of
optimization results obtained from the last sequential iteration
j1. By including a constant 1 at the end of the state variables,
k  [xk; 1], we can then obtain the discrete dynamics in a
linearized state-space form, as similarly outlined in [8, 34].
d) Linear momentum and CoM position: The dynamics
evolution of CoM position pc is embedded in the linear
momentum equation as an equality constraint:
e) Friction pyramid: The friction pyramid is a conser-
vative approximation of the friction cone when the pyramid
is inscribed, such that the pyramid friction coefficient is then
approximated as
where  is the actual ground friction coefficient. The linear
inequality constraint is
f) Contact-switching Constraints: For periodic walking
the contact switches for each contact point i. Hence, the
ground reaction wrench can be switched on or off based on
whether a leg is in swing or stance,
In addition to the control input saturation, we also enforce
stationary foot location for each footstep while the contact
schedule i,k  1 for contact point i.
g) Dynamic Range of Foot location: With the future foot
location as part of the optimization variables, the constraints
can be directly applied with only one-step preview data in
discrete terrain - the bounds of the foot location are dependent
on the position of the robot,

trated in Fig. 7.
