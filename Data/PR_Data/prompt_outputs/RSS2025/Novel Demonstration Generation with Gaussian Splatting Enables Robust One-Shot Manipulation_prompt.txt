dress these issues by augmenting image observations in RGB
space or employing Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipelines based on phys-
ical simulators. However, the former is constrained to 2D data
simulation caused by inaccurate geometric reconstruction. This

3D Gaussians. Specifically, we reconstruct the scene through
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), directly edit the reconstructed

RoboSplat significantly enhances the generalization of visuomo-
tor policies under diverse disturbances. Notably, while policies
trained on hundreds of real-world demonstrations with additional

I. INTRODUCTION
Imitation learning for visuomotor policies has emerged as a
promising paradigm in robot manipulation. However, policies
learned through imitation often display limited robustness
in deployment scenarios that differ substantially from expert
domains in the training data. Increasing the volume and
diversity of real-world data is an effective strategy for en-
hancing robustness ; however, acquiring human-collected
demonstrations is prohibitively time-consuming and labor-
intensive. Consequently, substantial efforts have been devoted
to generating diverse expert data without engaging with real-
Simulated environments offer a low-cost platform for data
synthesis [49, 69]. However, the Sim-to-Real gap presents
significant challenges that hinder policy performance in real-
world scenarios. Although Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipelines can
narrow this gap considerably, replicating real-world manipula-
tion scenes in simulation remains complex and labor-intensive.
In particular, inaccuracies in geometric reconstructions often
lead to imprecise physical simulations. Moreover, existing
Real-to-Sim-to-Real approaches primarily generate data within
monotonously reconstructed scenes, resulting in policies that
are tailored only to those specific environments. Another line
of work sheds light on augmenting image observations for
better visual generalization. By editing different semantic parts
of the image, these approaches generate novel scene configura-
bodiment types , object types , and camera views .
While these image augmentation methods are convenient,
their limited consideration of 3D spatial information results
in spatially inaccurate data generation. For more effective
data augmentation, explicit 3D representations that retain
accurate spatial information and are realistically renderable
are required.
burgeoning approach to superior reconstruction and rendering.
Thanks to its explicit representation of the scene, 3DGS
enables interpretable editing of the reconstructed scene, which
paves the way for generating novel manipulation configura-
tions. Furthermore, as a 3D representation of the scene, 3DGS
retains spatial information from the real world and allows for
consistent rendering from multiple perspectives, which makes
it the real-world counterpart of a simulators graphics engine
for generating novel demonstrations.
Based on that, we propose RoboSplat, a novel and effi-
cacious approach to demonstration generation with Gaussian
Splatting. Empowered by 3DGS, we achieve a high-fidelity
reconstruction of the manipulation scene. In order to align the
reconstructed scene with real-world counterparts, we devise a
novel frame alignment pipeline leveraging differentiable ren-
dering of Gaussian Splatting. 3D Gaussians of different scene
components are segmented using off-the-shelf segmentation
models and the robot United Robotics Description Format
(URDF). Remarkably, as illustrated in Fig. 1, a single collected
expert trajectory enables us to generate novel demonstrations
across a wide range of visual domains. To be specific, Ro-
boSplat augments data across six types of generalization with
five techniques: 3D Gaussian replacement for varying object
transformations for different object poses; visual attribute
editing for various lighting conditions; novel view synthesis
for new camera perspectives; and 3D content generation for
diverse object types.
Compared to previous Real-to-Sim-to-Real and image aug-
mentation approaches, RoboSplat achieves more diverse and
spatially accurate data generation. Extensive real-world ex-
periments demonstrate that RoboSplat significantly enhances
the robustness of visuomotor policies against multiple dis-
turbances across tasks involving pick and place, tool use,
functional motion, articulated object manipulation, and long-
horizon skills. Specifically, compared to policies trained on
hundreds of real-world demonstrations that are further en-
riched with 2D data augmentation, our method increases the
average success rate from 57.2 to 87.8.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Generalizable Policy in Robot Manipulation
Recent advancements in manipulation have significantly
enhanced generalization. Some studies design the policy archi-
tecture to endow it with equivariant properties, which is helpful
to generalizing to different object poses [60, 61, 43, 13]. One-
shot imitation learning approaches like [54, 48, 6, 53, 70]
enable the policy to handle various object poses given only
one demonstration. Furthermore, some other work focuses on
generalizing the policy to different camera views [69, 46, 63],
scene appearance [30, 51], and embodiments . Some
studies exploit the power of Large Language Models (LLMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to endow robots with
generalization abilities [23, 7, 39, 14]. Instead of adopting
generalizable policy architecture, auxiliary learning objectives
and powerful foundation models, our work is concentrated on
generating high-quality, diverse, and realistic data to instill
generalization abilities to the learned policy.
B. Data Augmentation for Policy Learning
Given limited training data, data augmentation emerges
as a way to improve the robustness of the policy. Previous
work adopts image augmentation techniques to improve the
resistance of visuomotor policies to observation noises [29,
evaluated in simulated environments. To deploy learned poli-
cies in real-world setting, some previous work focuses on
augmenting the appearance of the scene by incorporating
image-inpainting models [67, 10, 9, 35]. Moreover, Tian et al.
generate augmented task demonstrations from differ-
ent camera views and aim to learn a view-invariant policy.
Ameperosa et al. . Chen et al.  further devise a cross-
embodiment pipeline by inpainting different robots to image
observations. Nonetheless, these studies mainly augment task
demonstrations on 2D images, which lack spatial information.
augmented demonstrations might be unrealistic compared to
those generated directly from 3D representations. Our work

lation. In order to predict the consequence of robots interac-
tions with the environment, Shorinwa et al.  leverage 3D
semantic masking and infilling to visualize the motions of the
objects that result from the interactions. Another line of work
adopts the Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipeline, and utilizes 3DGS to
reconstruct the real-world scene [31, 40, 56, 52]. However,
importing reconstructed real-world objects to simulation is a
strenuous process, and physical interactions tend to suffer from
large sim-to-real gaps due to the flawed geometric reconstruc-
tion and lack of physical information in 3D reconstruction.
Some recent work on 3DGS is centered around editing and
relighting of the scene [65, 32, 17]. Our method enables
autonomous editing of the reconstructed scene to generate
diverse demonstrations with various configurations.
III. PRELIMINARIES
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)  utilizes multi-view
images for high-fidelity scene reconstruction. The scene is rep-
resented by a set of Gaussians tgiuN
gi consists of a position vector i P R3, a rotation matrix
Ri P R33, a scaling matrix Si  diagpsqps P R3q, an
opacity factor i P R, and spherical harmonic coefficients ci
that encapsulate the view-dependent color appearance of the
Gaussian. Given the scaling matrix and rotation matrix, the
covariance matrix i is calculated as follows:
i  RiSiSJ
To derive the color C of a particular pixel during render-
ing procedure, 3DGS exploits a typical neural point-based
value is calculated as follows:
p1  ojq,
oi  i  exp p1
where N is the number of Gaussians that overlap with the
pixel. Besides, i denotes the opacity of the i-th Gaussian.
i P R2 denotes the offset between the current pixel and the
center of the i-th Gaussian projected to 2D image. i,2D P
R22 stands for the covariance matrix of the i-th Gaussian
projected to 2D image.
IV. METHODOLOGY
To generate high-fidelity and diverse data from a single
expert trajectory, we present RoboSplat, a novel demonstration
generation approach based on 3DGS. An overview of our
method is shown in Fig. 2. In this section, we describe
RoboSplat in detail. We begin with the process of reconstruc-
tion and preprocessing in Sec. IV-A, which includes object
and scene reconstruction, frame alignment with differentiable
With all the Gaussian models ready, we generate novel demon-
strations and perform data augmentation in terms of object
demonstrations and directly deployed on real robots, as de-
tailed in Sec. IV-C.
A. Reconstruction and Preprocessing
In pursuit of a high-fidelity reconstruction of the scene,
we first capture a set of RGB images whose corresponding
viewpoints should be as various as possible. During this
default joint configuration, which we refer to as qdefault. With
the images ready, we utilize COLMAP [45, 44] to obtain a
sparse scene reconstruction and an estimation of the camera
pose corresponding to each image. To further enhance the
reconstruction precision, we gain an depth estimation for each
image with Depth Anything . The images, camera poses,
and depth prior serve as inputs to 3DGS , which returns 3D
Gaussians representing the entire scene Gscene, which contains
3D Gaussians corresponding to the robot, dubbed Grobot.
represented in an arbitrary frame Fscene, and hence we need to
align it with the real-world coordinate frame Freal to facilitate
automated editing.
The robot URDF gives us access to the robot base frame
FURDF. The real-world robot frame Frobot, FURDF, and Freal
are all aligned with each other. Hence, the actual problem
turns into the frame alignment from Fscene to FURDF. We
denote the transformation matrix as TURDF, scene. While point
cloud registration approachs, such as Iterative Closest Point
(ICP) , serve as a common solution to it, we find that there
is still major misalignment between the two frames aligned
with point cloud registration, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The
reason lies in the fact that point cloud registration is based on
point coordinates, whereas 3D Gaussians have a scale attribute,
which causes a mismatch between point coordinates and the
appearance. Therefore, we exploit the differentiable rendering
of 3DGS to do further fine-grained alignment, as depicted in
Suppose T 0
obtained through ICP. We first apply T 0
leading to a partially aligned robot Gaussian Grobot. The aim
of further alignment is to derive another transformation matrix
to the pose of the robot defined in URDF. For this sake, we
select N canonical camera views to capture the segmentation
masks tIURDF
i1 and tIGaussian
i1 (the pixel value is 1 if it
belongs to the robot; otherwise, it is 0) with the robot URDF
and Grobot respectively. The pixel-wise differences between the
images from the same canonical views are averaged to form
the objective function of alignment:
Lalign  1

Due to the differentiability of Gaussian Splatting, we can

to optimize the translation, rotation, and scale, which are then
applied to the 3D Gaussians.
rewrite the objective function as Lalignp Trelq and optimize Trel
through gradient descent. The optimized Trel is composed with
the scene reconstruction in Freal. We refer to the aligned 3D
Gaussians as G
In order to decompose the scene into different parts, we first
leverage Grounded-SAM  to perform task-related object
segmentation. Then, the masked images are used to reconstruct
3D Gaussians for the objects. The 3D Gaussians corresponding
to each link of the robot are segmented using the point cloud
of each link in FURDF, which can be obtained with the robots
URDF and the renderer. Specifically, if the position of a 3D
Gaussian is within a threshold distance from the point cloud
of a link, the 3D Gaussian is assigned to that link. If a 3D
Gaussian does not belong to any object or any link of the
robot has l links and there are totally k objects in the scene.
The reconstructed robot links, objects, and background are
denoted as G
robot  tG
respectively.
Similar to our frame alignment strategy, we utilize differ-
entiable rendering to estimate the deployed camera poses in
order to narrow the gap between the generated data and the
deployment environment. The camera extrinsics are optimized
through gradient descent, with the optimization objective:

lected expert demonstration, IGaussian represents the rendered

for the robot under novel joint configurations. To achieve
i1 and the
default joint configuration qdefault. For each link 1  i  l, we
access its relative pose to robot base frame under arbitrary joint
configuration q through forward kinematics, denoted as T i
fkpqqT i
we derive the corresponding 3D Gaussians under configuration
q. The entire 3D Gaussians are thereby derived by composing
Gaussians of all l links. As for the manipulated objects,
we apply transformations in a similar manner. The way 3D
Gaussians are transformed is detailed in Appendix A.
B. Novel Demonstration Generation
Utilizing 3D Gaussians in Freal, we implement our demon-
stration augmentation process, which systematically enhances
the expert demonstration Dexpert across six aspects: object
1) Object Pose
To perform object pose augmentation, we first extract
keyframes from the expert demonstration using a heuristic
approach. Whenever the gripper action toggles or joint ve-
locities approach zero, we consider the current time step as
a keyframe and record the end-effector pose with respect to
robot base frame. After that, we apply rigid transformations
to the target objects that are involved in the expert demon-
stration. The end-effector poses at keyframes are transformed
equivariantly according to the target object. Eventually, we
generate trajectories between consecutive keyframe poses with
motion planning, the combination of which makes a complete
augmented demonstration with novel object poses.
2) Object Type
The object types can be augmented with 3D Content Gen-
eration. We first prompt GPT-4  to generate approximately
50 names of objects that can be grasped. Then, we use these
object names as prompts to generate corresponding 3D Gaus-
sians with a 3D content generation model . We utilize an
off-the-shelf grasping algorithm  to generate grasp poses
with respect to the object frame. As we generate different
object poses for augmentation, we obtain the corresponding
end-effector poses by composing object pose and the grasp
pose relative to the object, which turn into the keyframe poses
in new demonstrations. The entire augmented trajectory is
generated in the same manner as IV-B1.
3) Camera View
One merit of 3DGS lies in its ability to perform novel view
synthesis. Thereby, we are able to choose different camera
poses from Dexpert and obtain novel-view demonstrations. Al-
though we can render novel-view observations from arbitrary
camera pose, we need to ensure that the augmented camera
view does not deviate so much from the expert that it loses
sight of the manipulation scene. Hence, we first designate
a target point Oc  pxc, yc, zcq in Freal, towards which the
camera should face during the entire episode. We then define
a coordinate frame Fc, whose origin is Oc and orientation
is the same as Freal. The position of camera is represented
by spherical coordinates pr, , q in Fc. Thus, by limiting the
target point within the manipulation scene and randomizing the
spherical coordinates, we are able to generate camera poses
that produce meaningful observations yet possess diversity.
The hyperparameters of randomization for the target point and
the spherical coordinates are detailed in Appendix B.
4) Embodiment Type
To generalize the expert demonstration to different types
of robots, we replace G
robot with the 3D Gaussians of an-
other embodiment, dubbed Gnew
the corresponding URDF file or real-world reconstruction.
The keyframe end-effector poses are reused because they are
embodiment-agnostic action representations. Hence, through
motion planning, we can easily derive the end-effector poses
and joint positions of the new embodiment for all time steps
in augmented demonstrations. The 3D Gaussians of the new
embodiment under novel joint configurations is obtained from
robot as mentioned in Sec. IV-A. The policy trained on
these augmented demonstrations is directly deployed on novel
embodiments.
5) Scene Appearance
Inconsistency between scene appearance accounts for a
large visual gap between training and deployment environ-
ments. To resolve this issue, we propose to exploit recon-
structed diverse 3D scenes and also large-scale image datasets
to augment the scene appearance. We adopt COCO
as the image dataset, and attach images to the table top
and background 3D Gaussian planes that surround the entire
manipulation scene. Moreover, we gather datasets for 3D
reconstruction [22, 66, 26, 4], and derive corresponding 3D
Gaussians by 3DGS training. The resulting 3D Gaussian
scenes substitute for G
for data augmentation. The edge of utilizing reconstructed
3D scenes is their consistent and diverse geometry across
multiple camera views, which helps produce more realistic
demonstrations. Nevertheless, due to the expense of 3DGS
training on large-scale reconstruction datasets, we complement
them with 2D images for greater appearance diversity.
6) Lighting Condition
Discrepancy in lighting conditions is another barrier to
deploying trained policy in unseen scenarios. To compensate
for that, we augment the diffuse color of each Gaussian in
the reconstructed scene through random scaling, offset, and
noise. Concretely, for a Gaussian with original diffuse color
as psrr  or  r, sgg  og  g, sbb  ob  bq, where
The scaling factors and offsets simulate changes in color
contrast and scene brightness. Thus, they are shared among
all the Gaussians in the scene. On the other hand, the random
Gaussian noise is sampled independently for each Gaussian to
simulate noise in images captured by cameras. The details of
scaling factors, offsets, and Gaussian noise are elaborated in
Appendix B.
An illustration of augmented demonstrations with six types
of generalizations can be found in Appendix B.
C. Policy Training
We employ a modern, widely adopted transformer-based
architecture [18, 51, 38, 55] to serve as the policy network,
which is detailed in Appendix C. We process RGB images
with ResNet-18 , and encode joint state using a multi-
layer perceptron (MLP). The latent of images and robot state
is fed into a transformer encoder. Finally, an action decoder
utilizes an MLP to convert the action latent into the action
vector at. The policy is trained with Behavioural Cloning (BC)
in an end-to-end manner, aiming to maximize the likelihood
of expert actions in demonstrations. We denote ok fi pIk, qkq
as the observation at the k-th frame of demonstrations D, and
as our policy. The loss function can then be expressed as
LBC  Epok,akqD}ak  pokq}2.
on-base cameras. We adopt relative end-effector pose as the
action representation, which depicts the relative transformation
between two consecutive end-effector poses under robot base
frame. Further details of the training process can be found in
Appendix D.
V. EXPERIMENTS
We conduct comprehensive experiments in the real world
to verify the effectiveness of our demonstration generation
pipeline. Specifically, we aim to answer: given a single expert
demonstration and multi-view images of the scene,
1) How efficient is data generation compared to manually
collecting data?
2) How does the policy trained on generated demonstrations
perform across various tasks compared to that trained on
manually collected data?
3) How does the policy perform as the generated data scale
4) Can generated demonstrations enhance the robustness
of the policy when facing various deployment settings, such

as changes in object types, camera views, scene appearance,
lighting conditions, and embodiment types?
A. Experimental Setup
The real-world experiment setup is presented in Fig. 5.
search 3 (FR3) Robot. Two Intel Realsense D435i eye-on-base
cameras are mounted on the table top, capturing RGB image
observations for the policy. We employ a 3D SpaceMouse to
collect teleoperated demonstrations at a frequency of 10 Hz.
Policy inference is carried out on an NVIDIA RTX4090 GPU,
with a latency of 0.1s imposed.
In order to manifest the generalization ability of our pipeline
to different task settings, we select five tasks for evaluation:
Pick Object, Close Drawer, Pick-Place-Close, Dual Pick-
In Pick Object task, the policy picks up a target object
which is placed at different poses within a 30cm40cm
workspace. In Close Drawer task, the policy closes a drawer
whose position is constrained to a 15cm40cm workspace,
while its rotation about the z-axis is restricted to r

objects are located in 10cm10cm workspaces, with yaw

five tasks require proficiency in executing basic pick-and-place

functional motion. Together, they provide a comprehensive
evaluation across various task settings.
We also conduct extensive real-world experiments to prove
the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline in terms of
different types of generalization. Notably, the evaluation of
object pose generalization is incorporated into all experiments,
including those focused on the other five types of generaliza-
tion (object types, camera views, embodiment types, lighting
pose generalization is a fundamental requirement for task
completion ability. For the other five types of generalization,
the details are provided in Sec. V-D. Success rate (SR) is
chosen as the evaluation metric in all experiments. Each policy
is evaluated with 30 trials for a certain evaluation setting.
B. Efficiency of Augmenting Demonstrations
To answer Question 1, we need to justify that our pipeline
is economical with both labor and time when generating data.
The labor-saving property is obvious because demonstrations
are generated automatically in our pipeline. We compare the
average time consumption of manually collecting a real-world
demonstration to that of generating a demonstration through
our pipeline. Specifically, we adopt eight processes on an
NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU for paralleled data generation to
efficiently utilize computational resources.
The comparison study is conducted on all five tasks, and
the result is shown in Table I. Our data generation pipeline
that executed on a single GPU is more than 29 times faster
than collecting data in the real world, with an average time
consumption of 0.64s across all five tasks. With no human
to generate visually diverse training data with little time
expenditure.
C. Performance of the Policy Trained on Augmented Data
To answer Question 2 and 3, we compare the policies
trained on generated demonstrations and manually collected
demonstrations in terms of their success rates when facing
various object poses. Moreover, we explore the performance
of policies as generated data gradually scale up.
The main results of the experiment are illustrated in Fig. 7.
While policies trained on real-world demonstrations still have
an edge over those trained on the same number of generated
rate as the generated demonstrations scale up. Concretely,
visuomotor policies trained on 800 generated demonstrations
achieve comparable performance to those trained on 200 man-
ually collected demonstrations. Moreover, training with 1800
generated demonstrations raises the success rate to an average
of 94.7, significantly surpassing the success rate achieved
with 200 manually collected demonstrations. It is also worth
mentioning that the policy achieves a 96.7 success rate on
Dual Pick-Place task with our generated data, which is nearly
20 higher than the baseline (manually collected). These
findings testify the effectiveness of our method in generating
novel object poses for better generalization of visuomotor
data scales up.
D. Robustness when Facing Various Deployment Settings
To answer Question 4, we augment the expert demonstration
in five different dimensions: lighting conditions, scene ap-
We compare policies trained on real-world data, real-world
data augmented using 2D augmentation approaches, and data
generated via our pipeline. An illustration of the experiments
for different generalization types is shown in Fig. 8.
1) Lighting Condition
To demonstrate the effectiveness of lighting augmentation
in our approach, we adopt five different scenarios for policy
performance of four policies that are trained respectively on:
1) 200 real-world demonstrations (Collected);
2) 1800 generated demonstrations with only object pose
(Ours Pose-Only);
3) real-world demonstrations augmented with color jitter
(Color Jitter);
4) 3200 demonstrations generated by our pipeline with both
lighting condition and object pose augmentation (Ours).
As shown in Fig. 9, policies trained on augmented lighting
conditions achieve an average of over 80 success rate across
Pick Object, Close Drawer, and Pick-Place-Close tasks, with
an overall improvement over those trained on real-world data
without augmentation by 70. Furthermore, our policies show
a significant edge over those trained on generated demonstra-
tions with augmented object poses and real-world demonstra-
tions augmented with color jitter, justifying the validity of
lighting augmentation in our pipeline.

demonstration over 100 demonstrations. Our method achieves more than 29 times the speed compared to the baseline.

2) Scene Appearance
Similar to the experiment on lighting conditions, we select
five different scenarios for evaluation on scene appearance
policies for comparison are trained in a similar manner as
described in Sec. V-D1, with the key difference being that we
employ image inpainting methods
robust and suitable 2D augmentation baselines for appearance
generalization. The results are shown in Fig. 9. The policy
trained on data generated through our pipeline, incorporating
both appearance and object pose augmentations, achieves
superior performance compared to all baselines. Notably, it
demonstrates over a 70 increase in success rates across all
three tasks when compared to policies trained on data without
appearance augmentation. In particular, our policy achieves
100 success rate on the Pick Object task, showcasing strong
robustness against various background appearance.
3) Camera View
We employ two different settings for camera view gener-
from the training perspective. On the other hand, cameras are
kept moving in moving view experiments. Similar to Sec. V-D1
and Sec. V-D2, we compare the performance of four policies
that are trained respectively on:
1) 200 real-world demonstrations (Collected);
2) 1800 generated demonstrations with only object pose

from different views;
4) 3200 generated demonstrations with camera view aug-
mentation (Ours).
We present the results in Table II. Our policy is able to per-
form Pick Object task and Pick-Place-Close task with success
rates of over 80 and 50 respectively, while the policies
trained on data without augmentation can barely accomplish
the task. Our approach also outperforms VISTA by a large
margin. Notably, our policy achieves nearly 100 success rate
on Close Drawer task, manifesting strong robustness against
novel camera views and moving cameras.
4) Object Type
In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
augmenting object types, we compare the performance of three
different policies that are respectively trained on:
1) 400 real-world demonstrations with 5 real-world objects
(Collected);
2) 6400 demonstrations stemmed from 200 real-world
utilizes image inpainting models to generate data with
unseen objects;
3) 6400 demonstrations generated by our pipeline with ob-
ject type augmentation (Ours).
During deployment, we select five real-word objects that are
different from all the objects covered in training process. We
report the result in Fig. 10. The policy trained on 50 object

proving the success rate of baseline models by over 40. This
demonstrates the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline
in utilizing off-the-shelf 3D Content Generation models to
generalize policy to novel objects.

5) Embodiment Type
Our method supports generating demonstrations across dif-
ferent embodiment types as mentioned in Sec. IV-B4. To prove
Research 3, we generate novel demonstrations for a UR5e
robot equipped with a Robotiq 2F-85 gripper and deploy the
learned policy directly in the real world. It is worth noting that
policies trained on Franka Research 3 robot demonstrations
fail to be deployed on UR5e robot due to frequent safety
violations. We compare the performance of policies trained
on embodiment-augmented demonstrations with those trained
on data augmented using RoVi-Aug . RoVi-Aug modifies
real-world demonstrations by replacing the appearance of the
embodiment through generative models.
We present the performance of policies in Fig. 11. Policies
trained on data generated using our pipeline achieve a success

We evaluate the learned policy directly on the UR5e robot
and achieve a nearly 100 success rate that surpasses the 2D
augmentation methods.
VI. LIMITATIONS
Due to the limitations of naive 3D Gaussian Splatting, it
is incapable of handling deformable objects. Additionally, the
pipeline lacks physical constraints, making it unsuitable for
contact-rich and dynamic tasks. However, recent advancements
in Gaussian Splatting [58, 1, 64, 42] provide promising oppor-
tunities to address these challenges. Future work could apply
these techniques to generate data for a wider range of tasks.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this work, we introduce RoboSplat, a novel demonstra-
tion generation approach that requires only a single collected
demonstration and generates diverse and high-quality data for
policy learning. Comprehensive real-world experiments show
that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of
visuomotor policies when encountering various disturbances.
