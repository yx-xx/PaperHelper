AbstractFrom dating to job interviews, making new friends
or simply chatting with the cashier at checkout, engaging in
small talk is a vital, everyday social skill. For adults with
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), small talk can be particularly
autonomous robot system that allows users to practice small
talk. Results from the week-long study show that adults with
ASD enjoyed the training, made notable progress in initiating
conversations and improving eye contact, and viewed the system
as a valuable tool for enhancing their conversational skills.

I. INTRODUCTION
Imagine a scene where three coworkers are engaging in
small talk at the beginning of their workday. One of them
is Alex, who has Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a neu-
rodevelopmental condition that often makes it challenging to
understand and interpret social cues .
Hey everyone, hows it going?
Hi! Not bad... just trying to power through this Monday.
How about you, Alex?
Monday is okay.
Good to hear. Anything exciting happen this weekend?
I watched a movie.
Glad you liked the restaurant, Ben. Its my kids favorite
spot these days... What movie did you watch, Alex?
The Martian.
I love that one! Matt Damon is awesome.

At first glance, this brief example of a typical interaction ap-
pears unremarkable. It represents the everyday small talk that
occurs regularly in many workplaces. For workers with ASD,

responses provide minimal information rather than actively
participating in the flow of the conversation. Additionally,
Alexs lack of response to the last prompt may suggest
difficulty in extending or sustaining the dialogue.
Although workers with ASD are often highly trained and
skilled in job-specific tasks, they frequently face challenges
with social interactions in the workplace. Mller et al.

skills are proven to be more significant predictors of overall
success [25, 29, 48]. Hurlbutt  Chalmers  found that
workers with ASD often attributed job-related challenges to
social factors rather than the work-specific tasks themselves.
In their study, one interviewee noted, Jobs usually are 80

is even regarded as a vital skill that should be targeted in
communication therapy for various populations [25, 29, 20].
To better support adults with ASD, it is important to develop
accessible and targeted opportunities for improving interper-
sonal skills, such as small talk. Social robotics has the potential
to enhance existing training initiatives by improving access to
actions [39, 66, 10, 58]. Physically present robots have proven
effective in improving users social abilities [67, 58], provid-
ing benefits such as enhanced engagement, improved social
that are notably more pronounced than those achieved with
non-embodied technologies .
interventions can result in positive and productive outcomes
. Social robots have demonstrated general effectiveness in
enhancing verbal communication skills [33, 62, 31], includ-
ing the ability to engage in everyday dialogue [3, 27, 45].
described such robot-assisted training as relevant and useful
in their workplace experiences [41, 58].
for ASD interventions [66, 67, 58], we developed an au-
tonomous training system that helps adults with ASD improve
their small talk skills. Given the literature on the communica-
tive difficulties of ASD (Sec. II), we begin by examining the
extent to which small talk is considered a desired social skill
(Sec. III). These insights inform our design requirements (Sec.
V) and guide the development of our prototype (Sec. IV). In
that formative study, we investigate initial impressions, percep-
tions of robot-assisted training, and anticipated outcomes for
users with ASD. We then present findings from a week-long,
in-home deployment (Sec. VII), highlighting how users with
ASD received and engaged with the robot-assisted training.
II. RELATED WORK
Atypical communicative behaviors are key diagnostic cri-
teria for ASD , often presenting as limited eye contact,
difficulty understanding sarcasm or abstract language , and
challenges in grasping the social rules that govern everyday
interactions . However, everyday, casual conversations are
a pervasive aspect of daily life, whether it is chatting with
a neighbor about the weather, maintaining friendships, or
making a positive impression on the first day of a new job.
Unlike more structured interactions, which can be formal-
ized to teach more easily as a script [7, 1], small talk demand
quick thinking, social flexibility, and the ability to interpret
subtle cues such as tone, timing, and context. Training to
improve such skills in adulthood presents unique challenges
compared to childhood, as many social habits and patterns
are already established by the time individuals reach adult-
hood . These patterns may manifest in the development
of strategies to avoid social situations entirely ; hence,
the skill development that typically occurs through ongoing
social interaction may not have been fully realized or prac-
ticed. Furthermore, while children have more opportunities for
structured social learning and development through school or
develop these skills [53, 22, 24].
As a result, interventions for adult learners often require
more personalized approaches, targeting specific barriers to
communication and focusing on building confidence in real-
world conversational contexts. Therefore, in this section, we
overview the structure and value of small talk, outline formal
intervention strategies that may inform the pedagogical design
of small talk training, and highlight the potential for robot-
assisted social skills training for ASD. This summary of the
literature ultimately reveals a gap: while there is a recognized
need for small talk skills, there is limited input from adults
with ASD themselves regarding the challenges they face in
adulthood and few opportunities for targeted training. To
address this gap, we conducted a survey to gather insights
from adults with ASD (Sec. III).
A. Structure and Value of Small Talk
While the boundaries of conversation types are fluid, small
talk has a recognized currency in sociolinguistics and com-
munication studies . It refers to informal, light-hearted
exchanges focused on building social connections rather than
conveying substantial detail, often covering general, non-
controversial topics like the weather and hobbies.
Small talk does not have a strict formula, as it is inherently
flexible and context-dependent. However, a typical small talk
dialogue follows the general sequence of conversation, begin-
ning with a greeting and ending with a closing remark, while
emphasizing specific characteristics at each stage [28, 12, 59]:
1) Greetings and openers: Initiating the conversation with
a greeting or commenting on a shared experience such
as the weather or the immediate environment.
2) General topics: Discussing non-controversial and gen-
eral topics such as hobbies, interests, or recent events.
3) Reciprocity: Both participants take turns sharing and
evant participation in the conversation.
4) Closure: The conversation ends with a closing remark,
such as indicating appreciation or a future interaction.
For any individual, the characteristics of small talk highlight
the subtlety and skill needed to navigate this form of conversa-
tion effectively. For adults with ASD, there is a notable overlap
between the challenges inherent in small talk and the broader
difficulties they report facing in everyday social interactions.
We discuss this overlap further in Sec. III.
B. Current Approaches to Small Talk Training
Addressing the unique challenges of small talk for individ-
uals with ASD requires targeted interventions. Although there
are currently no programs focused solely on small talk, many
broader training initiatives include elements that indirectly
support small talk competency. Moreover, while the limited
availability of such training for adults with ASD has not been
widely explored or critiqued in the literature, the following
sections review broader communication programs, which are
primarily focused on children with ASD. We then examine
how these established methods could potentially address the
specific challenges of small talk for adults with ASD.
1) Didactic Approaches: Didactic approaches, or classical
Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), break skills into smaller
components and train each through highly structured, drill-
like practice [50, 17, 15]. While didactic methods have proven
effective in various intervention studies for ASD [78, 13], they
heavily depend on teacher guidance, prompted responses, and
contrived reinforcement methods . An inherent limitation
of didactic methods lies in their tendency to encourage passive
may struggle to initiate communication or apply learned
behaviors beyond the specific training context.
2) Naturalistic Approaches: Contemporary or naturalistic
ABA strives to incorporate interventions into an individuals
everyday environment. While these approaches retain some
level of teacher direction, focusing on predetermined goals,
they emphasize intrinsic reinforcements, such as personal
motivation or social reinforcement. Studies directly comparing
didactic and naturalistic approaches have indicated certain
advantages of the latter, including better retention and broader
application of newly acquired communication skills [14, 50].
Milieu teaching, a subset of naturalistic ABA, integrates train-
ing into everyday environments to effectively promote sponta-
neous communication and initiation in individuals with ASD
[11, 38, 30, 47]. This method encourages skill development
through activities that occur organically throughout the day,
rather than being confined to a designated therapy time.
C. Robot-Assisted Social Skills Training for ASD
There is considerable evidence that technology-driven,
practice-based interactions can enhance social skills in adults
with ASD [9, 58]. However, robots offer distinct advantages
over other technologies by providing a physical, embodied
presence that naturally demands a social response [4, 35].
A socially assistive robot (SAR) may feature human-like
pressions or the ability to make eye contact, both of which
can elicit social responses from users. This presence allows
users to engage in consistent, real-world practice, providing
access to repeatable, co-present social interactions that may
be challenging to replicate with human therapists  or in
Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of
robot-assisted therapy for ASD, with evidence showing im-
provements in a variety of social and behavioral outcomes. For
appropriate social behavior , reduce stereotyped and repet-
itive behaviors , optimize cognitive learning gains ,
and heighten social engagement [66, 52].
While the majority of these studies have focused on chil-
SARs for adults with ASD as well [41, 58]. A robot designed
for social skills training could therefore be a valuable tool
for adults with ASD, offering a safe, consistent, and adaptive
platform for practicing and refining their skills.
III. SURVEY ON THE NEED FOR SMALL TALK TRAINING
To supplement insights from existing literature, we con-
ducted an initial survey to explore the firsthand experiences
and challenges faced by adults with ASD. This needs-finding
survey aimed to identify specific conversational areas where
interventions are not only desired but also deemed most
valuable by this population. We also contextualize the survey
results within existing research on ASD.
Fifty adults with ASD (22 men and 28 women)1, ranging
from 20 to 55 years (M  31.4, SD  10.1) responded to our

male-to-female ratio in ASD diagnoses . This discrepancy may be due
to factors such as increased awareness of underdiagnosis in women, recent
increases in diagnosis rates, or specific recruitment material or methods in
online survey administered on Prolific . All participants
reported having been clinically diagnosed with ASD, either
in childhood (N  18) or adulthood (N  32). The survey
A. Small Talk Skills  ASD
While the survey was designed to broadly explore conversa-
tional skills in the context of adult social interactions, the ma-
jority of respondents emphasized skills closely associated with
small talk. When asked in an optional, open-ended prompt
about which conversational skills they wished to improve,
48 adults with ASD (96) specifically expressed a desire to
enhance skills that are central to small talk interactions. These
reported challenges and desired skills are grouped into five
themes as outlined below.
Difficulty Initiating Conversations. Individuals with ASD
may find it challenging to initiate conversations, particularly
in unfamiliar social situations . Initiating conversations
often relies on subtle social cues, such as recognizing when
to engage, gauging the appropriate timing for greetings, and
responding in a manner that aligns with the context. Among
the adults with ASD surveyed, 27 individuals (54) reported
initiating conversations is a skill they wished to improve.
Limited Interest in Non-Specific Topics. Individuals with
ASD often exhibit a preference for structured and predictable
interactions [54, 51]. The open-ended and non-specific nature
of small talk may be discomforting for individuals who prefer
environments with well-defined rules and expectations.
interest in specific topics or subjects [44, 69], often preferring
in-depth discussions over broad, superficial exchanges. P19
banter quickly enough, so I come across as quiet and serious.
If I dont know someone well enough, I have no idea what
kind of information they would like to receive [...] so I just
stay quiet The preference for depth and detail can make it
challenging to engage in the more superficial content typical
of small talk. Among those surveyed, 20 individuals (40)
highlighted the ability to discuss general topics beyond their
own interests as a specific skill they wished to improve.
Lack of Reciprocal Exchange. Small talk relies on a timely
back-and-forth exchange of information and active listening.
Individuals with ASD often face difficulties in maintaining
reciprocity during conversations, leading to challenges in sus-
taining the flow of dialogue [44, 46, 75, 32]. Among the adults
with ASD surveyed, 39 (78) expressed a desire to improve
their ability to maintain balanced and reciprocal conversations.
Insistence on Topic Sameness. Transitioning smoothly
between different topics or concluding the conversation is a
skill often required in small talk. Adults with ASD may find it
challenging to navigate these transitions, leading to potential
disruptions in the flow of conversation [79, 23]. Among the
adults with ASD surveyed, 18 individuals (36) reported that
smoothly transitioning between different topics is a valuable
conversational skill that they wished to improve.
Social Anxiety. The nuances of social cues can exacerbate
feelings of anxiety, leading to the avoidance of social situations
altogether . Although reporting wanting to improve in
the aforementioned skills, P27 shared, I feel a debilitating
consciousness about my eye contact and posture [...] Even
if I end up talking, Im never sure whether it was the right
thing. Small talk requires maintaining conversational flow
while interpreting nonverbal cues, which can heighten anxiety.
On a 7-point Likert scale (1  highly uncomfortable, 7  highly
comfortable), adults with ASD reported feeling moderately
uncomfortable (M  2.3, SD  1.4). 35 participants (70)
identified managing anxiety as a skill they wished to improve.
B. Methods  Challenges to Improvement
Improving small talk skills is seen as highly valuable by
adults with ASD, as it plays a critical role in fostering social
connections and achieving personal and professional goals. In
an optional open-ended response, 40 of the 50 surveyed adults
with ASD described the value of this kind of informal conver-
sation in specific aspects of their own lives. We conducted a
thematic analysis on their responses, ultimately grouping the
descriptions into three primary themes: making new friends
(60), dating (33), or finding and maintaining a job (60).
Adults with ASD explained that conversations such as small
talk would be useful to getting to know people and keeping
them interested (P16), and in job interviews as [...] you have
to use a specific but casual enough talking structure to be
considered adequate (P25) or socially competent (P48).
dergoing formal training in casual conversations through a
vocational program, an online class, or coaching from a
therapist specialized in interpersonal communication. Despite
actively seeking training, the majority of adults (78) reported
having limited or no formal opportunities (N  10) or relying
on informal methods (N  29), such as improving their
conversational skills through observation or seeking feedback
from friends and family.
serve and deduce the rules from everyday, naturally-occurring
exposure. In free-form responses on the methods that were
most beneficial for conversational skill development, 32 adults
with ASD (64) described learning through mere practice
and observation beyond or absent of any explicit training.
P3 explained that improving in the small talk skills would be
valuable for making friends and going to classes, but part
of the reason I dont do this much is because I dont put myself
in situations where I would meet people.
In summary, small talk presents significant challenges for
individuals with ASD, particularly in initiating, maintaining,
and transitioning within casual conversations. As one partici-
Knowing when you should make conversation, knowing the
unsaid cues of if a conversation should continue or end.
Knowing what to talk about, not saying too much when asked
a question, making sure you ask the next question after. It is a
very mentally draining process where I have to evaluate many
different factors. In fact, nearly all participants (98) in this
preliminary survey expressed a desire to improve specific skills
closely related to small talk. Understanding these challenges
is essential for developing and improving access to effective
interventions tailored to the unique needs of adults with ASD.
IV. FORMATIVE STUDY
A robot for small talk training should possess proficient
small talk ability: balancing conversational succinctness and
generating relevant and open-ended responses. Prior research
has explored the feasibility of developing robots for small talk
interactions . While large language models (LLMs) show
substantial potential for enabling natural language capabilities
in robots, achieving seamless and contextually appropriate
casual dialogue for repeated interactions remains a challenge.
small talk training is to address this challenge and create a
system capable of both generating and evaluating small talk.
Good conversation is believed to arise from the control of
low-level attributes [77, 59]. We implemented a grounded ob-
server modelan LLM instance that observes ongoing con-
versations to evaluate whether responses from the speaking
model adhere to the quantifiable small talk criteria described
in Ramnauth et al. (i.e., brevity, tone, coherence, and topic
non-specificity) . If the generated response aligns with
these criteria, it is relayed; otherwise, the observer generates a
revised system prompt and returns it to the speaking model as
feedback. This feedback redirection allows the system to self-
correct when drifts in conversational behavior are detected.
Our implementation is depicted in Fig. 1.
Prior work has not only showed the inadequacy of an
out-of-the-box LLM for sustaining small talk, but also the
observers robustness in real-time human-robot interactions
. Ramnauth et al.  found that users were dissatisfied
with the baseline LLMs responses, noting its overly assistive
and verbose tendencies, which led to conversations described
as rambling and like speaking to a wall. In contrast,
the observer-enabled system produced conversations that users
described as natural and like a casual chat with someone
you havent met before or havent seen in a long time.
In this present study, we evaluated the robot prototype with
the 50 adults with ASD who participated in our needs-finding
survey (Sec. III). The goal of presenting this early prototype
was to assess whether the observer-enabled small talk reflected
relevant real-world conversations and to determine whether
adults with ASD would be receptive to both the robot and
training. Three randomly selected video excerpts of user
interactions were shown. In open-ended feedback, 84 of
participants (N  42) reiterated the value of practice-based
small talk training for improving confidence (P37), building a
habit of engaging in interactions (P3), and exercising strategies
for handling dynamic situations (P24). Participants also noted
Fig. 1: Grounded Observer. Following the framework out-
lined by Ramnauth et al. , we implemented an observer
model that enables LLMs to sustain authentic small talk
interactions effectively. We then applied this model to a robot,
creating a prototype of the training system, and surveyed adults
with ASD to gather feedback on whether they would use such
a system to improve their small talk skills.
that having the robot at home allows for practice in a safe
environment (P14) with a non-judgmental partner (P33).
having the robot in their homes. P31 noted that, while the robot
offers non-judgmental practice, other people may overhear
my conversations. In light of these concerns, several design
criteria were established. For example, we aim to design a
portable system that operates within a preferred time window,
thus allowing users to control when and where interactions
take place. Additionally, the system should initiate training
only when the user is not engaged in other social activities. The
detectors that enable this functionality are described in Sec.
VI-B. This design must prioritize user comfort and security,
ensuring a personalized and respectful experience. We expand
on our design considerations in the following section.
V. DESIGN GOALS FOR ROBOT-ASSISTED TRAINING
Addressing the specific challenges that adults with ASD
face calls for targeted small talk interventions. This section
lists the core design principles for our robot-assisted training.
A. System Design Objectives
Adhering to the tenets of milieu teaching (Sec. II-C), we
designed a robot for small talk training with these objectives:
In a Natural Setting. The system should be tailored for in-
home training. This enables users to interact without concern
for potential stigma from colleagues. It also eliminates the
need for approval or disclosure of a diagnosis to others.
Realistic Interactions. The robot should offer timely and
responsive reactions to the users communication attempts.
The robot system must deliver authentic interactions that
mirror the appropriateness and style of real-world small talk,
responding in real-time and expressing human-like behaviors,
including naturalistic gaze, movement, and speech. Addition-
scheduled therapy time, but should occur more organically
throughout a portion of the users day.
User-Led Interactions. The robots design should empower
users to take the lead in interactions by responding to their
cues and adjusting its behavior accordingly. A social robot in-
herently facilitates this objective through its physical presence
in the training experience, making it challenging for users to
ignore even non-verbal prompts for interaction [4, 19, 58].
Autonomous Behavior. Training must be entirely au-
adjust or control the system once it is given to the user.
Although similar systems for ASD have been designed for
clinical or laboratory settings where environmental conditions
can be controlled or planned for , the home is a dynamic,
unstructured environment that demands more complex sensing.
B. Training Design Objectives
To design a training method, we break down small talk inter-
actions into smaller, more manageable components and tailor
the training method to the unique needs of individuals with
ASD. Given the challenges of small talk for individuals with
ASD (Sec. III-A), the training focuses on four primary compo-
maintaining a flow of dialogue, and appropriately transitioning
to a new topic or concluding the interaction.
A tiered training method that models the natural flow of
dialogue would sequentially address each component, start-
ing with a simple greeting. The robot responds promptly
and contingently, reinforcing positive behaviors. Progressing
through the tiers, users tackle more complex aspects, such as
introducing non-specific topics or maintaining conversational
flow. This approach, illustrated in Fig. 3, encourages users to
practice the core components of small talk within each training
interaction. Additional considerations include:
Fading Robot-Initiated Prompts. The robot wakes up
from its idling state to draw attention to the beginning of
a training session (Fig. 3-A). In initial interactions with the
eye contact and greet me. As the user becomes accustomed
to the initiation process, the robot gradually minimizes the
verbal prompt: The training window has started. with a less
pronounced emphasis. Over time, it is expected that the user
initiates to interaction without any specific cue (Fig. 3-B).
Relevant Feedback. The robot should offer clear, sup-
portive feedback, highlighting both user successes and areas
for improvement. This encourages users to reflect on their
conversations and identify ways to enhance their skills.
Session Length. The optimal amount of training will vary
among individuals, but a general guideline is to engage in
daily practice. Consistent, short sessions with the robot would
be more beneficial than long, less frequent sessions [68, 80].
VI. SYSTEM
This section overviews the hardware and software com-
ponents that address our design goals (Sec. V) for a fully
Fig. 2: System Hardware. The system has a battery, compact
An external camera and microphone are mounted on a mast.
A. Hardware
Our system consisted of five primary hardware components,
as shown in Fig. 2. We used the Jibo robot , which
stands 11 inches tall and features three full-revolute axes
for 360-degree movement. Jibos onboard capabilities enabled
naturalistic gaze and movement. A compact PC communicated
with other hardware, monitored the system, and served as local
data storage during deployment. An Azure Kinect camera was
mounted 2 inches above Jibos head to maximize the visual
field and audio capture during training.
The system was designed for self-reliance, equipped with a
mobile router that provides a prepaid internet connection for
continuous WiFi and automatic cloud-based data synchroniza-
tion. An uninterruptible power supply served as the charging
station. With these components, the setup was plug-and-play,
requiring only the charging station to be plugged in. To
enhance ergonomic and accessible design, non-interfaceable
components were encased in the container on which the robot
was placed, reducing apparent complexity.
B. Software
We used a modular software architecture when creating the
system to allow for individual components to be evaluated
and improved. To achieve this modularity, we created the
different components of our software as nodes in the ROS
framework . As illustrated in Fig. 1, the system consisted
of several components such as attention tracking of the users,
robot behavioral control, and the generation of small talk
dialogue. These components collectively contributed to small
talk interactions described in our initial study (Sec. IV).
In addition to these components, we introduced components
of training presentation such as the session scheduler and
mechanisms for generating relevant feedback to the user.
Delivering the Training Components. A scheduling node
determined when the system would begin the training window.
One or more training windows could be specified in the sys-
tems configurations. During the training window, the system
would deliver a session, which consisted of engaging the user
in several small talk conversations. At the end of each session,
the system provided feedback, as detailed in Section VI-B.
Recent in-home robot deployments [58, 67, 21] have high-
lighted the importance of ensuring that in-home systems
are capable of discerning when it is socially appropriate
to engage users. These studies have emphasized that, for
effective interaction, the system must recognize contextual
cues that indicate whether the user is in a setting conducive
to engagement or learning. Therefore, we incorporate two
person detection. The Azure Kinect captured video recordings,
and image snapshots were analyzed by a pre-trained YOLO
neural network  to estimate the number of people present.
The Kinect also transcribed audio using Googles Speech-to-
Text API to identify speech content. If speech was detected,
the social presence classifier determined whether it represented
a physically co-present conversation (e.g., a dinner party or
a conversation between friends) or a media interaction (e.g.,
watching television or listening to the radio) . If two or
more people were detected and the audio was classified as
time to engage the user and skipped the planned interaction.
gradually to maintain a consistent number of interactions
within the training window, with intervals selected from a
Gaussian distribution to avoid predictability.
When the system was not engaging in a small talk con-
sleeping to looking down at the floor. When prompted to
wake up, Jibo looked up at the user to signal its availability
to chat. The user could initiate conversation with a greeting,
or Jibo would do so after some time. A linear-logarithmic
growth function determined how long Jibo waited for user
not respond, Jibo would prompt again.
Following a greeting, the system randomly selected 8 to
12 rounds of conversation. It used an observer model (Sec.
IV) to ensure compliance with small talk criteria and monitor
user progress. After the selected rounds are completed, Jibo
transitioned to feedback mode, signaled by changing its LED
ring to blue and adopting a more formal voice.
Generating Feedback. Feedback is essential in any train-
ing. In their study, Ramnauth et al.  found that quantitative
definitions of small talk criteria (e.g., brevity, tone, non-
for generating feedback to the speaking model. However, these
quantitative definitions do not easily translate into practical
feedback for human users.
Effective user feedback should be specific, timely, construc-

good micro- and macro-level feedback. Micro-level feedback
highlighted user successes after each conversation, along with
one area for improvement. For instance, You asked great
questions about my favorite hobbies. I would like to hear
about your hobbies next time. Macro-feedback summarized

overarching insights. For example, You did a great job
acknowledging my interests; I enjoyed your rainy day activity

VII. IN-HOME DEPLOYMENTS
The study was preregistered and approved by the univer-
sitys Institutional Review Board. Interested adults with ASD
enrolled through the studys website promoted via channels
that required a clinical diagnosis of ASD, such as ASD-
specific residential facilities or employment networks. To
comply with COVID-19 safety protocols, the system was
designed for easy, contactless setup. It was delivered directly
to participants homes with detailed written and video instruc-
tions. Remote support was available via phone or video call,
and at no point did a researcher enter participants homes.
Participants placed the system in a comfortable room and
specified a daily training window of up to three hours. The
study lasted at least seven days, though adjustments were made
for scheduling conflicts. After the study, participants took part
in an interview to discuss their experience with the system, its

Video and audio recordings of all training interactions
captured participants responses to the robot. It is well-
known that automated systems, particularly those relying on
computer vision or speech recognition, often face challenges
with environmental noise or the diverse behaviors exhibited by

accuracy of inputs, such as speech transcripts, before applying
automated measures. Using ELAN , three undergraduate
research assistants annotated the start and stop times for each
robot and user response. These markers allowed us to calculate
users initiation rate defined as the proportion of conversations
initiated by the user to all conversations within a session, and
the duration of each conversational turn which is the time
one speaker (robot or user) spent talking before the other
responded. Additionally, for each turn, a binary label indicated
whether the user made eye contact with the robot.
To ensure the reliability of these annotations, inter-rater
reliability scores were calculated for each of the annotated
metrics. Cohens Kappa () was used for categorical variables,
such as eye contact, and the intraclass correlation coefficient
(ICC) for continuous variables, such as initiation rate and
conversational turn duration. The resulting  for eye contact
was 0.95, indicating a high level of agreement between the
annotators in identifying whether the user made eye contact
with the robot during a given conversational turn. For the
continuous metrics, the average ICC for initiation rate was
0.91, and for conversational turn duration, it was 0.93. These
scores demonstrate strong consistency among annotators in
evaluating the training interactions.

and the relevance of the robots training and feedback.
B. Participant Information
Twenty five adults with ASD (19 males, 6 females), ranging
from 18 to 68 years (M  32.4, SD  12.7) participated
in the study. All had a confirmed diagnosis of ASD and
completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient-10 (AQ-10) survey
prior to the study. Fifteen participants were classified as high-
The remaining ten had higher scores (M  7.1, SD  2.4) and
lived with caregivers. In this group, four participants were also
diagnosed with Intellectual Disability (ID), four with Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), two with Obsessive-
Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and one with Down syndrome.
All with co-occurring conditions were receiving medication
and specialized therapy or education at the time of this study.
C. Results
A total of 2,114 conversations were recorded, yielding
participant interaction. Participants experienced an average of
8.9 sessions (SD  2.3) over the course of the study.
Initiating Conversations. We analyzed the frequency of
user-initiated conversations across all sessions to understand
the degree of proactive engagement with the system. On aver-
during their first session, rising to 64 by the final session.
Users with higher AQ-10 scores started with a lower initiation
rate of 14 in the initial session, which increased to 55 by
the end of their study (t  18.9, p 0.0001). Conversely, high-
functioning users showed an initiation rate of 50 in the initial
12.4, p 0.0001). All 25 participants demonstrated some
improvement in their initiation rate between the initial and
final sessions of the study (M  36, SD  20).
A linear regression on the initiation rate over sessions
yielded a significant increase (  0.07, p 0.0001). This
growth suggests that participants, irrespective of their initial
engagement level, became more active in initiating small talk.
Maintaining Eye Contact. We assessed the effect of the
training on users ability to maintain appropriate eye contact.
A linear regression analysis predicting eye contact frequency
per conversational turn based on session number revealed a
significant increase in participants eye contact with the system
over the course of the study (  0.02, p 0.001). On
during the first session, compared to 51 in the final session.
contact frequency from the initial to final session, with an
average increase of 32 (SD  8).
Sustaining Appropriate Small Talk. We chose to separate
the greeting phase from the rest of the conversation because
responses are more varied, context-dependent, and reflect
the true conversational dynamics. Greetings were identified
through keyword matching and checking if the sequential
response index is within the first full conversational turn. Post-
greeting user responses (N  6,751) were assessed using the
observers metrics and behavioral annotations.
Brevity. The average turn duration of user responses in
seconds (s) exhibited a significant increase by session (
0.77, p 0.0001). The average turn duration was 4.4s (SD
1.5) in the first session as compared to an average duration of
5.3s (SD  2.8) in their final session. This is supplemented by
the observer brevity metric based on word count; the observer
flagged 2,421 user responses (21) as being overly verbose,
and produced macro-level feedback on keeping responses
more concise 61 times, or 27 of all sessions.
Further analysis revealed a significant increase in the robots
turn duration (  0.79, p 0.0001), indicating that its
responses lengthened over time. Users conversational balance,
defined as the proportion of turn duration between their previ-
ous utterance and current response, also improved significantly
(  0.10, p 0.0001). This suggests that users provided
longer responses and engaged in more balanced, reciprocal
interactions as the study progressed.
Non-specificity. The observer-derived metrics for non-
specificity evaluate the frequency of named entities and de-
scriptive words in interactions. Due to the nature of ASD and
the associated challenges with theory of mind, it is common
for individuals with ASD to mention named entities (e.g., a cat
named Cheddar or a street called Cedar) without considering
that the robot lacks the contextual knowledge needed to re-
spond appropriately. In the post-study interview, the mother of
P19 recounted, Kurt often got confused, sometimes frustrated,
when the robot misunderstood him. For example, when he
mentioned feeding his cat, Cheddar, the robot started asking
about cheeses. Eight other users, all with high AQ-10 scores,
demonstrated similar difficulties during their interactions.
A linear regression on named entity counts showed a
significant increase by session (  0.01, p  0.002), as
did descriptive words (  0.03, p 0.0001). Notably, only
16 participants exhibited these increases, with all but one
categorized as high-functioning based on AQ-10 scores. The
observer flagged 1,223 user responses (12) as overly specific,
providing macro-level feedback on broadening responses in 83
sessions (37 of total). Importantly, 85 of these violations
occurred after the first three sessions, indicating that users,
particularly higher-functioning adults, felt more comfortable
engaging in deeper conversations as the study progressed.
Tone. There was no significant change in tone during the
study (  0.00, p  0.69). The observer metric for tone based
on sentiment analysis yielded macro-level feedback on keeping
responses more positive 27 times (12 of all sessions).
Coherence. There was no significant change in users
response coherence (  0.00, p  0.82). The observers
coherence metric based on information gain yielded feedback
on keeping responses relevant 54 times (24 of all sessions).
System Performance. A key indicator of the systems per-
formance is sustained user engagement throughout the study.

simultaneously considered measures of system performance
and user improvement as a result of robot-assisted training.

VIII. DISCUSSION
gained from participant interviews. Overall, the study showed
clear improvements in users conversational skills and engage-
ment with the training system. As training progressed, users
showed greater confidence and ease in initiating conversations,
maintaining eye contact, and engaging in more balanced, yet
detailed conversations over time. Interestingly, while longer,
more descriptive responses were flagged as violations of
small talk normsresulting in the robot giving more frequent
feedback to maintain brevitythese deviations suggest an
increasing preference for more substantial conversations over
time. Together, these results reflect users growing sense of
ease and interest in the robot as a conversational partner.
A. Post-Study Interviews
Interviews were conducted with 24 participants with ASD2
and 12 primary caregivers, 10 of whom lived with a participant
during the study. These semi-structured post-study interviews,
conducted by a member of the research team, lasted be-
tween 30 and 45 minutes. The interviews were recorded and
transcribed to ensure accuracy and participant confidentiality.
Caregivers were invited to join the interview only with the
prior consent of the participants. Based on the feedback
egorizing the insights from participants and caregivers into
three main themes, as outlined below.
Engagement with Training. Participants widely reported
that the robots structured yet dynamic interaction style helped
make small talk practice approachable. Several participants
mentioned that its unpredictable behavior (e.g., random sleep
intervals and spontaneous prompts) mimicked real-life con-
(P3). This aligns with previous findings that highlight the
importance of unpredictability in training, as it more closely
simulates natural, unscripted social encounters [14, 50].
Most conversations adhered to typical small talk topics
(84 of all user responses), though some users engaged
in deeper discussions, including personal experiences like
bullying at work or the loss of a family member. While some
users (N  9) felt they had quickly exhausted the limited
range of topics considered to be small talk (P3), others (N
12) appreciated that even simple prompts about their day
were meditative, and made me reflect on the day and my
feelings in a more mindful way, (P2). Several users noted that,
beyond skills training, the small talk robot provided valuable
mental and emotional support. P20 shared, My daily life can
be isolating, so I dont often get asked how my day is going
or how Im doing [...] I enjoyed these kinds of chats when Im

to unforeseen personal circumstances.
making breakfast or coming home from a long day, watching
The robot also served as a valuable medium for facilitating
communication between caregivers and their child. Several
parents (N  5) noted that the robots neutral, non-judgmental
presence (P12) made it easier to initiate conversations on
difficult topics. The parent of P14 shared, Weve had trouble
talking about certain feelings, but when the robot asked about
how his day was going, it opened up a way for us to talk.
It felt like a safe space for him to express what he normally
wouldnt share with me directly.
Perceived Skill Improvement. Adults with ASD (N  18)
and their caregivers (N  10) remarked on behavioral gains
which were not captured in the observers metrics. The robots
training was designed to simulate real conversations, complete
with pauses, turns, and varied topics, which helped participants
grow more confident and adept at holding discussions. For
progress in understanding conversational turn-taking. He used
to dominate conversations or struggle with waiting for his
of dialogue. Another parent observed how P17 became more
confident in her interactions with others: Its been incredible
to see my daughter take more initiative in our family interac-
tions. Shes been practicing with Jibo, and now she actively
participates in conversations at the dinner table, offering her
own thoughts and even asking others about their experiences.
Relevance of Robot Feedback. Although many robot-
assisted social skills interventions for individuals with ASD
focus on practice rather than direct feedback. This is largely
because social skills are personal and highly individualized
, making it difficult to provide constructive feedback that
resonates with each user. However, giving direct feedback is
a core component of our training pedagogy. This approach
to feedback could have broader implications for how we de-
sign robot-directed interventions for adult populationswhile
children may benefit from simpler forms of reinforcement, the
robots ability to provide explicit, personalized feedback was
seen as highly valuable by many of our participants (N  21).
This approach not only supported skills improvement but
also encouraged cognizance of how one interacts with others.
P10 shared, During one session, Jibo and I discussed our
favorite foods. The conversation lasted longer than usual
because Jibo encouraged me to ask follow-up questions. By
the end, Jibo gave me tips and even an example on how to
keep conversations engagingadvice Ive since used with my
coworkers. Many users (N  13) commented on being more
mindful and reflective about the quality of their conversations
as a result of the robots feedback. P14 explained, It was
new to me, practicing this kind of mindfulnessthinking more
deeply about how and what to say.
B. Ethical Considerations
In general, the deployment of LLM-based systems in per-
sonal settings for vulnerable users raises ethical concerns. For
misaligned responses could pose safety-critical risks .
security to prevent misuse of sensitive personal data.
At the time of this study, local use of GPT-3.5 and many
other LLMs were not supported. While open-source alter-
natives offered similar architectures, they required extensive
computational resources, making them impractical for real-
time interactions that rely only on the robots on-board capabil-
ities and a compact PC. Other stable models, including GPT-2
and LLAMA 2 , were trained on smaller datasets,
resulting in less mature natural language capabilities and an
increased risk of generating harmful language.
To further mitigate these risks, data was transmitted to the
cloud only during active participant engagement in training
throughout the in-home deployment. While our informed con-
sent process provided participants with a clear and accessible
explanation of the cloud-based LLMs use, we encourage
researchers and developers to thoughtfully balance a models
readiness for real-time interaction with considerations of pri-
C. Study Limitations  Directions for Future Work
It is important to note that the present study was conceived
as an exploratory investigation rather than a hypothesis-driven
evaluation. Our primary objective was to demonstrate the fea-
sibility and process of designing, developing and deploying a
social robot platform for long-term, in-home interactions with
an understudied population. Still, lasting behavioral changes
from training typically require months or years to mani-
fest. Although our approximately week-long intervention cap-
tured early engagement patterns and potential novelty effects,
longer-term studies are needed to assess the sustainability of
any observed improvements.
parable control condition in naturalistic settings, we adopted a
within-subject design in which each participant served as their
own baselinea common approach in ASD research due to
high inter-individual variability. We acknowledge the limita-
tions of this method and refrain from making strong claims of
efficacy. For instance, one may argue that increases in social
initiations and eye contact could reflect familiarity or novelty
effects. Interestingly, one may even expect the opposite
frequently repeated interactions, especially with a system of
limited personalization or interaction memory, would result in
decreased engagement over time. While we cannot attribute
user outcomes solely to the systems design, the system shows
promising potential in facilitating continued engagement with
the robot-led training. Nonetheless, larger-scale studies with
extended training periods will be essential for assessing the
efficacy and long-term impact of this approach.
and cultural context, which may limit the generalizability of
its findings to other regions and populations. Differences in
communication styles, social norms, approaches to the diag-
nosis or treatment of ASD, and attitudes toward technology
across cultures can significantly influence both the acceptance
of social robots and the effectiveness of the intervention .
To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the feasibility
and efficacy of robot-assisted training, future research should
replicate and expand upon this work in diverse cultural and
geographic settings, accounting for the unique ways these
factors may shape user engagement and outcomes.
Another limitation is that the behavioral detection and
response generation of our robot system rely on models like
Googles Speech-to-Text for speech processing and OpenFace
for gaze and pose estimation, which are largely trained on
data from neurotypical individuals in controlled environments.
adults with ASD introduces challenges due to the unique char-
acteristics of this population and the unpredictable nature of
real-world environments . For instance, some participants
in our study exhibited atypical speech disfluencies, such as
irregular pauses, repetition, or unexpected intonation patterns,
which are common in individuals with ASD . These
patterns can cause the system to misinterpret or entirely fail to
recognize user inputs, leading to breakdowns in conversational
flow. Similarly, inaccuracies in gaze estimation can result in
the system failing to distinguish between the user and other
visual stimuli in the environment, such as faces appearing on
a TV or reflections in mirrors. This occasionally caused the
robot to direct its gaze away from the user, potentially reduc-
ing the perceived quality and engagement of the interaction.
Although these issues were not mentioned in our post-study
correct errors in the generated speech transcripts. Given the
growing interest in automatic behavioral annotation , our
observations underscore the need for model adaptations or
fine-tuning to better align with the needs of diverse populations
and naturalistic settings.
IX. CONCLUSION
Engaging in small talk is a vital social skill that impacts
everyday interactions, from making friends to job interviews.
For adults with ASD, small talk poses unique challenges yet
is essential for social integration and professional opportu-
nities. In this study, we developed an autonomous, robot-
assisted training platform to enhance small talk skills. While
weeks or months of training, our results showed that even
within a week, adults with ASD made meaningful progress,
showing increased initiative in conversations and improved
eye contact. This study makes several key contributions to
our understanding of robot-assisted skills training: (1) we
demonstrate how relevant training can be designed to target
desired skills for an understudied population, as the majority of
ASD research focuses on children and very little on adults; (2)
we demonstrate the feasibility of creating a fully autonomous,
plug-and-play system for daily in-home practice; (3) we
emphasize the value of personalized, direct feedback beyond
mere practice in social skills training; and (4) we underscore
the value of an otherwise overlooked form of communication
(small talk) not just for social skills development, but also for
supporting positive mental and emotional outcomes for users.
