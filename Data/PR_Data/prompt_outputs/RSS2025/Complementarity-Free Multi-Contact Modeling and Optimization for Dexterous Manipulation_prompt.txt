AbstractA significant barrier preventing model-based methods
from achieving real-time and versatile dexterous robotic manip-
ulation is the inherent complexity of multi-contact dynamics.
Traditionally formulated as complementarity models, multi-
contact dynamics introduces non-smoothness and combinatorial
In this paper, we circumvent these challenges by introducing
a lightweight yet capable multi-contact model. Our new model,
derived from the duality of optimization-based contact models,
dispenses with the complementarity constructs entirely, providing
computational advantages such as closed-form time stepping,

a range of challenging dexterous manipulation tasks, including
fingertip 3D in-air manipulation, TriFinger in-hand manipulation,

diverse objects. Our method consistently achieves state-of-the-
art results: (I) a 96.5 average success rate across all objects
and tasks, (II) high manipulation accuracy with an average
reorientation error of 11and position error of 7.8mm, and (III)
contact-implicit model predictive control running at 50-100 Hz

I. INTRODUCTION
Achieving real-time and versatile dexterity in robotic manip-
and breaking contacts with various objects and physical
have been delivered by reinforcement learning [5, 45, 2, 13],
albeit at the expense of extensive environment data, lengthy
training process, and limited object generalizability. In contrast,
progress in model-based planning and control methods been
relatively slow, with existing methods typically limited to
simple contact-less manipulation settings. A primary challenge
for model-based methods is the non-smooth and hybrid nature
of contact-rich dynamics  smooth motions are frequently
interrupted by discrete contact events (i.e., making or breaking
contacts) [41, 26]. This introduces computational challenges
in both learning of contact dynamics  and combinatorics
optimization of contact modes [14, 41]. Recent work has made
some headway, including new algorithms for learning hybrid
dynamics [42, 28], differentiable contact modeling [22, 53, 65],
multi-contact predictive control [8, 64, 29, 30], and contact-
rich planning [14, 41]. Despite these efforts, the computational
challenges induced by non-smooth contact dynamics remain a
significant barrier for model-based methods to achieve the real-
time versatility needed for complex dexterous manipulation
involving diverse object geometries and robot morphologies.
This paper seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in model-
based dexterous manipulation by addressing a critical question:
Can we circumvent the computational challenges induced by the
non-smooth multi-contact dynamics in the early stage of contact
modeling? Unlike existing efforts [8, 64, 29, 30, 14, 41], we do
NOT pursue abstract learning architectures [37, 26], propose
artificial smoothing strategies for existing contact dynamics [22,
the hybrid decision space. Instead, our contribution is a new
multi-contact model that overcomes the non-smooth and hybrid
computational complexities via a physics modeling perspective,
enabling significant speed and performance improvement in
model-based dexterous manipulation.
mulations [15, 59, 57, 31, 55, 22] for modeling rigid-body
constructs in the dual space of the optimization-based contact
models [6, 59] into explicit forms. This results in a new
complementarity-free multi-contact model that has several com-
putational advantages. (I) Closed-form and differentiable time-
function of the current state and input, thus avoiding solving
complementarity problems , optimization , or residual
equations  for contact constraint resolution. (II) Automatic
satisfaction with Coulombs friction law in a single term: the
new model resolves the normal and frictional contact forces
using a single term that automatically respects the Coulomb
friction cone. This is unlike the contact models [19, 33, 56, 12]
that handle normal and frictional components independently,
leading to additional hyperparameters. (III) Fewer hyperpa-
easy to tune, and it also supports model auto-tuning using any
learning framework.
The goal of the new contact model is not to compete with
existing high-fidelity physics simulators [15, 59, 57, 31, 55, 22],
but rather to offer a lightweight, smooth, yet capable surrogate
that addresses the inherent computational challenges associated
with existing complementarity-based models, particularly when
used for contact-rich optimization and control. We integrate
this model into model predictive control (MPC) framework
for contact-implicit online planning and control. With minimal
hyperparameter tuning, we achieve state-of-the-art performance
across challenging dexterous manipulation tasks, including 3D
in-air fingertip manipulation, TriFinger in-hand manipulation,
and Allegro hand on-palm reorientation, all with diverse objects,
as shown in Fig. 1. Our method sets a new benchmark for
model-based contact-rich dexterous manipulation:
Highly versatile dexterity: 96.5 average success rate across
all objects and environments.
High-accuracy dexterity: average object reorientation error
of 11and position error of 7.8mm.
Real-time dexterity: contact-implicit MPC running at 50-100
Hz for all objects and robots.
II. RELATED WORKS
A. Rigid Body Multi-contact Models
1) Nonconvex Complementarity Contact Models: Rigid body
contact dynamics is traditionally formulated using comple-
mentarity models [51, 49, 52]: it enforces no interpenetration
and no contact force at a distance. The Coulomb friction
can also be expressed as complementarity constraints via the
maximum dissipation principle , leading to a nonlinear
complementarity problem (NCP). Since the NCPs cannot be
interpreted as the KKT conditions of a convex program, they
are challenging to solve. To simplify computation, Coulomb
friction cones are often approximated by polyhedral cones
[52, 59], converting the NCP into a linear complementarity
problem (LCP) , for which mature solvers exist .
2) Cone Complementarity Contact Models: In , Anitescu
proposed relaxing the NCP formulation, by constraining the
contact velocity within a dual friction cone. Then, the NCP
becomes cone complementarity problem (CCP), which attains
computational benefits such as fast convergence and solution
guarantees [7, 54]. A side effect of CCP is that it allows for
small normal motion at the contact even when bodies should
remain in contact. This creates a boundary layer whose size
is proportional to time step and tangential velocity .
3) Optimization-based Contact Models: The CCP described
above corresponds to the KKT optimality conditions of a convex
optimization problem with second-order cone constraints .
This allows for the formulation of a primal convex optimization
(with velocities as decision variables) or a dual optimization
(with contact forces as decision variables). The primal approach
has been used in work [41, 39], while the dual formulation is
used in the MuJoCo simulator , albeit with a regularization
term for model invertibility. The dual objective function can
be interpreted as minimizing kinetic energy in contact frames.
4) Differentiable Contact Models: Several alternative models
have been proposed to approximate complementarity-based
models for differentiability.  introduced penalty functions
to model contact normal and frictional forces.  proposes
relaxing complementarity constraint, which in optimization-
based model case, is equivalent to solving an unconstrained
optimization with constraints penalized via log-barrier functions
.  proposed implicit complementarity, converting all
constraints to unconstrained optimization with intermediate
variables. [62, 33] developed penalty-based contact models.
A shared feature is that those methods ultimately need to
solve a residual equation for contact constraint resolution, and
differentiability is obtained via implicit function theorem .
5) Why is our model new?: Two features distinguish the
proposed model from existing ones. First, closed-form contact
constraint resolution: our model builds on optimization-based
contact dynamics [6, 39], but instead of solving the primal [6,
39] or dual programs , we approximate the complementarity
constraints in the dual space with an explicit form (by contact
decoupling). This approximation leads to a closed-form contact
constraint resolution, eliminating the need to solve optimization
, residual , or complementarity problems  at each
time stepping.
while previous work [56, 12, 62, 33] has also explored
closed-form contact dynamics models, our novelty, however,
is that our closed-form model is approximated in the dual
friction cone. This allows for the unified treatment of contact
normal forces and frictional forces within a single term,
ensuring automatic sanctification with Coulombs friction law.
In contrast, existing models [56, 12, 62, 33] treat the contact
normal and enforce Coulombs friction separately, which
typically leads to additional hyperparameters and potential
nonphysical artifacts.
B. Planning and Control with Contact Dynamics
Planning and control for multi-contact systems are challeng-
ing because algorithms must determine when and where to
make or break contacts, with complexity scaling exponentially
with potential contact locations and planning horizons. Tradi-
tional methods [47, 35] predefine contact sequences, which
could be possible for tasks like legged locomotion . Modern
approaches focus on contact-implicit planning , solving for
both contact location and sequencing. Two main strategies are
proposed. The first is to smooth contact transition boundaries.
In [30, 43, 41, 36] complementarity constraints are relaxed. The
other is to maintain the hybrid structures and cast the planning
as mixed integer program, as done in [8, 9, 41, 1, 64, 24].
This paper develops the contact-implicit planning and control
based on the proposed complementarity-free contact model. The
resulting contact-implicit optimization can be readily solved
using standard optimization techniques  or MPC tools ,
requiring no additional smoothing constructs or optimization
programming effort. With its closed form and smooth nature,
our model significantly improves the speed of online planning;
e.g., our contact-implicit MPC controller runs up to 50-100
Hz in the Allegro Hand dexterous reorientation tasks.
C. Reinforcement Learning for Dexterous Manipulation
Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results
in dexterous manipulation [5, 45, 2, 13]. For instance, [5, 2]
employ model-free RL for in-hand object reorientation;
introduces an adaptive framework for reorienting various
objects. However, these methods require millions to billions of
environment samples. Model-based RL [26, 37] offers better
multimodality [37, 42]. The prior work  shows incorpo-
rating hybrid constructs into models significantly improves
of environment samples.
RL has set the state-of-the-art in challenging dexterous
manipulation tasks, e.g., TriFinger [26, 2] and Allegro hand
Our proposed method aims to bridge this gap and even surpass
state-of-the-art RL in success rate and manipulation accuracy.

A. Optimization-based Quasi-Dynamic Contact Model
For simplicity, we model a manipulation system using the
quasi-dynamic formulation [34, 14, 1, 41], which primarily
captures the positional displacement of a contact-rich system in
relation to contact interactions and inputs, while ignoring the
inertial and Coriolis forces that are less significant under less
dynamic motion. Quasi-dynamic models benefit from simplicity
and suffice for a wide variety of manipulation tasks [41, 14, 1].
It should be noted our following model can be readily extended
to full dynamic model, which will be shown in Section VI-B.

integrate from q to the next position q, and we simply write
it as q  q hv (can involve quaternion integration).

The generic formulation of model predictive control is

bounds), by minimizing the path c() and final cost V ().
In a manipulation system, the MPC policy is implemented
in a receding horizon fashion, by repeatedly solving (8) at
the real system state qreal
encountered at the policy rollout
step k and only applying the first optimal input to the real
system. Specifically, at the encountered system state qreal
MPC policy sets q0  qreal
and solves (8). Only the first
optimal input u
k ) is applied to the real system, evolving
the system state to the next qreal
k1. This implementation creates
a closed-loop control effect on the real system, i.e., feedback
from system state qreal
to control input u
C. Problem: Contact-implicit MPC for Dexterous Manipulation
We are interested in real-time, contact-implicit MPC for
dexterous manipulation. Directly using the QP-based contact
model (7) in MPC (8) leads to a nested optimization, which
is difficult to solve due to the non-smooth behavior of the
contact model (7), i.e., the prediction jumps" at the transitions
between separate, sliding, and sticking contact modes. The goal
of the paper is to develop a new surrogate multi-contact model
f in (8) to overcome the above challenges, enabling real-time
and high-performance MPC for dexterous manipulation tasks.
IV. COMPLEMENTARITY-FREE MULTI-CONTACT MODEL
A. Duality of Optimization-based Contact Model
We proceed by establishing the dual problem of the QP-based
contact model (7). First, define the shorthand notations:
of dimension
J Rncnd(nonr),  Rncnd, and  Rncnd.
constraints in (7). From convex optimization , it can be
shown that the dual problem of (7) is
T)TQ1(hb
The optimal primal solution v to (7) and the dual solution
to (10) has the following relationship
h2 Q1(hb
As pointed out in , the dual optimization (10) can be physi-
cally interpreted as finding the contact impulse  that minimizes
the kinetic energy in contact frame: 1
2vT(h2Q)v  1
It is noted that the dual solution to (10) is not unique because
the quadratic matrix
T is not necessarily of full rank.
In MuJoCo , to guarantee the invertibility of the contact

(10) into a strongly concave program
JQ1b  )T 1
where R Rncndncnd is a diagonal regularization matrix
with positive entries. The following lemma states the optimality
condition for the regularized dual problem (12).
Lemma 1. The dual solution to the regularized dual problem
(12) satisfies the following dual complementarity constraints:
The proof of Lemma 1 is in Appendix. This lemma indicates
solving (12) involves managing complementarity constraints.
B. New Complementarity-Free Multi-Contact Model
To circumvent the dual complementarity in (13), we propose
a new contact model based on Lemma 1. Assume, for now,
the inverse of the first matrix on the right side of (13) can
be replaced by a positive definite diagonal matrix K(q)
We will provide the physical justification for this assumption in
the next subsection. The following lemma states a closed-form
solution to the dual complementarity (13) with (14).
Lemma 2. Let a positive definite diagonal matrix K(q) replace
TR)1 as in (14). The dual complementarity (13)
then has a closed-form solution:
The proof of Lemma 2 is given in Appendix. Lemma 2 presents
an important result: by substituting
1 with a
positive diagonal matrix K(q), the complementarity constructs
in the original dual condition (13) are eliminated. Critically, this
substitution makes the contact time-stepping prediction (16)
have closed-form solution and free from complementarity. We
thus name (16) the complementarity-free multi-contact model.
Although the above treatment can cause the time-stepping
prediction v in (16) to differ from the true primal solution of
the original QP-based contact model (7), it offers significant
computational benefits, particularly for model-based multi-
contact optimization, as will be shown later. In fact, K(q)
has an intuitive physical interpretation, which will be discussed
in the next subsection.
While our complementarity-free time stepping (16) approxi-
mates (7), we do not expect the resolved velocity v to strictly
satisfy the original dual cone constraints in (7)although it
can potentially achieve so by appropriately choosing the matrix
K(q). In fact, relaxing the dual cone constraint in (7) provides
our model (16) with unique advantages that are not available
in (7), particularly in mitigating the non-physical artifacts with
(7) (or general Anitescu models [6, 7]), as we elaborate in the
next subsection and later experiments in Section VI-B.
C. Physical Interpretation of the New Model
We next provide the physical interpretation of the new
complementarity-free multi-contact model (16) using a 2D
fingertip manipulation example in Fig. 2. First, recall the
linearized dual cone constraints (6) in the original QP-based
contact model (7). Using (9), we can compactly express these
dual cone constraints as
In Fig. 2(a), the dual cone constraints are shown in red areas.
time step h on both sides of (16), leading to
noncontact
: contact contact force in contact dual cone
total force in generalized coordinate
Equation (18) shows that the proposed model (16) can be
interpreted as a force-spring system, where hv represents the
position displacement in the generalized coordinate, and the
right side accounts for the total force applied to the system.
The matrix Q, defined in (5), encodes the systems spring
stiffness in response to the total force. The total force consists
of two components: (i) the non-contact force b (e.g., gravity
and actuation forces), shown in green arrows in Fig. 2, and
(ii) the contact force contact : max
JQ1b  ), 0
shown in blue arrows in Fig. 2(c), applied within the contact
dual cone and then converted to
Tcontact in the generalized
coordinate. Without contact forces, the system displacement
would be Q1b, as shown in Fig. 2(b)-(d) from the dashed
object positions to the solid object positions.
By examining the contact force contact in (18) and combining
the contact dual cone constraint in (17), we have
contact  K
penetration depth into the contact dual cone (17)
due to the displacement Q1b caused by non-contact force b
proportional to the penetration depth into the contact dual cone,
Q1b from the non-contact force b. This has been shown in
black arrows in Fig. 2(c). Notably, the matrix K(q) introduced
in Lemma 2 represents the stiffness of the contact dual cone.
This is illustrated in blue in Fig. 2(c).
As analyzed above, our complementarity-free contact model
(16) actually leverages the penetrationviolation of the dual cone
constraints (17) (also see Fig. 2(c-d)) to generate spring-like
contact force. Thus, (16) has relaxed the dual cone constraints.
In fact, the dual cone constraints in (7) are more a mathematical
convenience than physical phenomenon (although [6, 7] provide
a microscopic physical interpretation). Strictly enforcing the
dual cone constraints will introduce non-physical artifacts (e.g.,
boundary layer effect), compared to non-convex complementary
models (NCPLCP) [51, 49, 52]. By relaxation of dual cone
will show in the later experiments in Section VI-B.

From (20), one can see that at the contact location i, the contact

By the triangle inequality, in
model (16) automatically satisfies the Coulomb friction law.

model (16) is not differentiable due to max operation. One thus
can replace max operation with smooth SoftPlus function

with  controlling its accuracy to max(x, 0). Thus, a differen-
tiable version of the complementarity-free multi-contact model

E. Extension to Dynamic Settings
Since the contact force contact in (18) is a spring-like force,
a natural extension is to include a damping term to stabilize
the contact resolution, as shown in Fig. 2(d), i.e.,

This extension can be less significant in quasi-dynamic systems,
because the velocities are small. However, it plays a significant
role in stabilizing contact resolution in dynamic simulation. In
Section VI-B, we will demonstrate the behavior of the contact
simulation of (25) in dynamic scenarios. A comprehensive
investigation of the full dynamic complementarity-free multi-
contact model, however, is left for future work.
V. COMPLEMENTARITY-FREE CONTACT-IMPLICIT MPC
With the proposed complementarity-free multi-contact model,
the MPC formulation (8) becomes

In (26), at each prediction step t, the contact Jacobian

the predicted state qt using a collision detection routine .
the MPC optimization (26) is challenging due to its non-
differentiability. Fortunately, in a receding horizon framework,
one can do once collision detection for each encountered real-
system state q0  qreal
to obtain
J(q0) and (q0), which then
remain fixed inside the MPC prediction. This is equivalent
to linearizing the contact geometry, which works well for
short-horizon MPC (i.e., T is small). We summarize the
complementarity-free contact-implicit MPC in Algorithm 1.

VI. CONTACT SIMULATION AND COMPARISON
A. Quasi-Dynamic Setting
We first test the performance of the complementarity-free
model in predicting a contact-rich pushing-box scene in quasi-
dynamic setting, shown in Fig. 3. In this setup, a bar with
a linear joint (moving left-right), actuated by a low-level
position controller, pushes varying numbers of cubes on a
frictional ground. We compare the proposed model (23) with
QP-based model (7). Since no true quasi-dynamic model exists
for benchmarking, the comparison is primarily visual, with
the metric being the timing for time-stepping calculation. The
model settings are in Table I.

Although in the proposed model (23), K(q) is configuration-
matrix with identical entries. Our later experiments show that
this setting is sufficient for decent contact-rich prediction.
Further discussion on setting K(q) is provided later. The
QP-based contact model (7) uses OSQP solver  for time-
stepping. For both models, we initialize the environment with
the same random q0 and set the same input ut  0.001. The
prediction horizon is T  1000 steps. The predicted scenes of
pushing 10 boxes at different time steps are shown in Fig. 3(a).
To compare the timing of one-step prediction, we varied the
number of cubes ncube, and the results are given in Fig. 3(b).

that the proposed model is 5x faster in one-step prediction. This
is expected as the proposed model has an explicit time-stepping
solving a quadratic program at each time step.

classical complementarity-based multi-contact models, a naive
QP-based model (7) (in the dynamic form), and the MuJoCo
simulator . We will demonstrate that the proposed model:
(I) mitigates non-physical artifacts commonly observed in QP
models (7) and in general Anitescus contact models such as
the CCP  and Convex  models, due to the relaxation of
dual cone constraints; and (II) achieves sufficient smoothness
in contact dynamics due to the spring-damper-based contact
resolution (25). Evaluation is conducted in three task settings.
In all dynamic settings below, instead of using the quasi-
dynamic model (1), we employ the full dynamic model with
current system position q and velocity v:
M(q)v M(q)v  h(q, v)
where M(q) is the configuration-dependent inertia matrix, and
represents the sum of all non-contact forces, including inertial,
follows that Q  M(q)h2 and b  M(q)vh(q, v). As
discussed in Section IV-E, the extended complementarity-free
contact model (25) further incorporates a damping term with
a diagonal damping matrix D(q).
Fig. 4: Left: a sphere is accelerated between two frictional planes
under an external force (green arrow). Right: the tangential velocity
of the sphere versus time. NCP [21, 51] and BLCP  contact
models capture the acceleration, while the velocity plateaus for the
CCP  and Convex  models due to the "sheath effect" induced by
the dual cone constraints. The proposed complementarity-free model
mitigates such issue because it allows for "violation" of the dual cone
constraints while also introducing significant smoothness.

coefficient is 0.3. In the extended complementarity-free model
(25), we set K(q)  20I and D(q)  6I. We compare the
proposed (25) with NCP [21, 51], BLCP , CCP  and
Convex  contact models. The results are shown in Fig. 4.
With an external force, the sphere is supposed to accelerate
with only contact with the lower plane. NCP [21, 51] and BLCP
capture this. However, CCP  and Convex  models
lead to the plateaus of velocity, so-called sheath effect". This
is because dual cone constraints in CCP and Convex models
create the vertical motion of the sphere, leading to the contact
force from the top plane (the red arrows in the left of Fig. 4
show the contact impulses.). If the sphere needs to go faster,
both planes need to move farther away. In contrast, because our
proposed model (25) has relaxed the dual cone constraint, our
model can effectively mitigate such effect: the plateau velocity
of our model is higher than CCPConvex. Fig. 4 also shows the
softness of our model. This is expected because our generation
of the contact force is handled as a spring-damper system (25)
in the dual cone (Fig. 2(d)), which a smooth mapping (24)
from system motion.
Fig. 5: Left: an unactuated box sliding with initial horizontal velocity.
Middle and right: the horizontal velocity and vertical position
artifacts due to the enforcement of dual cone constraints, the proposed
model significantly mitigates these effects by relaxing the dual
cone constraints. Compared to MuJoCo, our model yields noticeably
smoother velocity profiles.
2) Setting 2: Unactuated Cube Sliding with Initial Horizontal
a frictional ground with an initial horizontal velocity of 2.0
ms until it comes to rest, as shown in Fig. 5. The friction
coefficient is set to 0.5, and the simulation time step is 2
ms. In the extended complementarity-free model (25), we
use K(q)  I and D(q)  0.3I. The baselines include the
naive QP-based model (7) (in dynamic form) and the MuJoCo
simulator . Results are shown in the middle and right panels
of Fig. 5. The vertical position trajectory (right) shows that the
QP-based model (7) exhibits vertical motion artifacts due to the
enforcement of the dual cone constraints, whereas the proposed
model significantly mitigates these effects by relaxing the dual
cone constraints. The horizontal velocity trajectory (middle
plot) further demonstrates that, in comparison to MuJoCo, our
model yields smoother behavior as a result of the soft handling
of contact forces (24).
Fig. 6: Left: cube free falling, rolling, and sliding on ground. Middle
and right: the horizontal and vertical velocity trajectories, respectively.
Compared to MuJoCo, our model yields noticeably smoother velocity
profiles. Increasing the stiffness K leads to increased oscillations in
the contact resolution.
3) Setting 3: Cube Free Falling, Rolling, and Sliding on
pose and velocity of the cube. Specifically, the initial position
linear velocity [1.0, 0, 0], and the angular velocity [20, 0, 0].
These initial conditions cause the cube to undergo free fall,
followed by rolling and sliding on the ground until it comes
to rest. We evaluate the extended complementarity-free model
(25) using two different stiffness matrices: K(q)  I and
K(q)  2I, while keeping all other parameters identical to
those in Setting 2. The baseline for comparison is the MuJoCo
simulator. As shown in Fig. 6, the proposed model produces
behavior similar to MuJoCo, but with noticeably smoother
velocity profiles. Moreover, increasing the spring stiffness K
leads to greater oscillations in the contact response, highlighting
the importance of incorporating a damping term in (25) for
stable and realistic contact behavior.
VII. FINGERTIPS IN-AIR MANIPULATION
With the quasi-dynamic complementarity-free contact model
(23), we evaluate the complementarity-free MPC (Algorithm
1) for three-fingertip manipulation tasks, comparing it to the
MPC of the QP-based contact model (7). Hereafter, we refer
to the latter as Implicit MPC since the QP-based model (7)
needs to be converted into its KKT conditions in the MPC (26),
similar to [43, 23], to order for the MPC optimization to be
solved with existing tools . All tasks below use MuJoCo as
simulation environments. The proposed complementarity-free
model (23) is only used in MPC for control optimization.
A. Environment and Task Setup
The three-fingertips manipulation system is shown in Fig. 7.
MuJoCo  is used for environment simulation. The three
fingertips (red, green, and blue) are actuated with a low-
level PD controller (Kp  100 and Kv  2) with gravity
compensation. We use four different objects: Stanford bunny,
diameter of those objects ranges from 0.08 [m] to 0.15 [m].
The initial pose of objects are statically lying on the ground
with random xy position (xobj
0 ) and random initial heading
(yaw) angle obj
Fig. 7: Three-fingertip manipulation of different objects. Three
fingertips (red, green, blue) are actuated. The tests include 4 objects:
(a) Stanford bunny, (b) cube, (c) foam brick, and (d) stick. The
transparent objects are the target poses. For visualization, we have
attached a virtual frame to the stick to show its pose. The diameter
of those objects ranges from 0.05[m] to 0.15[m].
We will consider three types of manipulation tasks:
On-ground rotation: The target object pose is on the ground.
The fingertips only need to move and rotate the object to
align it with the target.
On-ground flipping: The target requires flipping the object
on the ground, with some target poses in non-equilibrium.
In-air manipulation: The target pose is in the air. The
fingertips must coordinate to prevent the object from falling
while moving it to the target.
B. MPC Setting and Results

To show the versatility of the proposed complementarity-
free MPC, we use the same model parameters and MPC cost
function for all tasks and objects. The model setting is in Table
II. The MPC path and final cost functions for all objects and
tasks are defined as
c(q, u) : ccontact(q)  0.05cgrasp(q)  50 u2 ,

define each term below. The contact cost term, defined as
ccontact(q) :

The angle  between two normalized quaternions, q1 and q2, is calculated
is to encourage the contact between fingertips (position pfti)
and object (position pobj). The grasp cost term, defined as
cgrasp(q) :
obj  pft2
obj  pft3
is to encourage three fingertips to form a stable grasp shape.
obj is the unit directional vector from the object position
pobj to fingertip position pfti, viewed in object frame Robj:
pfti pobj.
This grasp cost is critical for in-air manipulation, where a
stable grasp is essential to prevent dropping. The weights for
each term in (29) are chosen based on the physical unit scale
. The control lower and upper bounds are ulb  0.005
and uub  0.005, and MPC prediction horizon is T  4. In
Implicit MPC, we set the complementarity relaxation factor
to 5  104 for its best performance, while keeping all other
parameters identical to those in the complementarity-free MPC.
We deem a manipulation task successful (and terminate the
MPC rollout) if both of the following conditions are met:
pobjptarget
targetqobj)2 0.015,
consecutively for 20 MPC rollout steps. A manipulation task
is deemed a failure if the object does not satisfy (33) within
the maximum MPC rollout length H  2000.
1) On-ground Rotation: In on-ground rotation, the target
object position ptarget[xtarget, ytarget, zheight]T is sampled as
xtarget and ytarget U[0.1, 0.1] [m],
and zheight is the height of the object lying on ground. The target
object quaternion is qtargetrpyToQuat(target, target, target),
with yaw target, pitch target, and roll target sampled as
target U[, ],
target  target  0.
For each object, we conduct 20 trials with different random
initial and target poses. The results are given in Table III, where
the manipulation accuracy is evaluated using
final position error:

both calculated using the last 20 steps of a MPC rollout. Fig.
8(a) shows a manipulation example for the Stanford bunny.
2) On-ground Flipping: Here, the random target object
position is sampled from (34), and the random target quaternion
qtargetrpyToQuat(target, target, target) is sampled by
target U[, ], target U[
2 ], target U[
Note that some target poses are in non-equilibrium.
For each object, we conduct 20 trials with different random
initial and target poses. The results are in Table IV, where we
quantify the manipulation accuracy by

Each objects results are based on 20 random trials. For implicit MPC, final position or quaternion errors are computed using all trials
due to fewer successful trials. For the proposed method, the errors are computed using successful trials.
3) In-air Manipulation: Here, we consider the target object
pose in mid-air. Without ground support, the three fingertips
must prevent the object from falling while moving it to
a target pose. The in-air target object position ptarget
[xtarget, ytarget, ztarget]T is sampled as
ztarget U[0.03, 0.08] [m].
The in-air target object orientation is
qtarget  AxisAngleToQuat(ntarget, target),
with random axis and angle sampled from
ntarget N([0 1 1]T, 0.1I),
target U[, ].
The results of in-air manipulation are listed in Table V. Due
to the very low success rate of Implicit MPC for this task type,
its results are not included. Manipulation accuracy is measured
using the metrics in (38). Fig. 9 shows some random examples
of in-air manipulation with different objects.

C. Result Analysis
On results in Tables III-V, we make the following comments.
(1) The proposed complementarity-free MPC consistently
outperforms Implicit MPC (i.e., MPC with complementarity
model) across various manipulation tasks in terms of success
Fig. 9: In-air manipulation examples. (a) Two random trials of bunny in-air manipulation. (b) Two random trials of cube in-air manipulation. (c)

and the final object pose and fingertips positions are in solid. The target object pose is coated in green. See supplementary video. Video link.
complex tasks like on-ground flipping and in-air manipulation.
(2) Quantitatively, the proposed complementarity-free MPC
consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, with 100 success
in on-ground rotation, over 95 in on-ground flipping, and
over 90 in in-air manipulation. The average of the final object
position error is 8.9 [mm] (noting object diameters range from
50 [mm] to 150 [mm]) and final quaternion error is 0.0035
(equivalent to 6.844) across all tasks and objects. The MPC
frequency consistently exceeds 58 Hz for all tasks.
(3) The above state-of-the-art results are largely due to the
optimization. In IPOPT solver, the complementarity-free MPC
optimization usually converges to a solution within around 20
iterations. In contrast, Implicit MPC optimization struggles and
takes longer to converge due to the numerous complementarity
D. How to Set the Model Parameter K?
Fig. 10: Complementarity-free MPC performance with different
parameter K values for on-ground rotation tasks. Shaded areas are
the standard deviation, computed from 10 random trials.
In the above implementation, model parameters (Table II)
follow standard setting , except for the new stiffness matrix
K. We simply set K as an identity matrix for all tasks. Now,
we examine how different K values affect MPC performance
using the bunny on-ground rotation tasks. All parameters follow
Table II, except K, which varies from 103I to 102I. For
each K, we run 10 trials with different initial and target poses.
MPC rollout length is 500. Fig. 10 shows the task performance
versus different K, where the final position and quaternion
errors (38) are calculated at the last rollout step.
Fig. 10 shows that good performance is achieved across
a wide range of K settings, from 0.01I to 10I. Outside
this range, MPC performance declines. This highlights the
flexibility in choosing an effective K value. Additionally, since
the proposed complementarity-free model is fully differentiable,
more complex K(q) settings can be learned from environment
VIII. REAL-TIME DEXTEROUS IN-HAND MANIPULATION
With the quasi-dynamic complementarity-free contact model
(23), the complementarity-free MPC is evaluated in dexterous
in-hand manipulation tasks with two environments:
TriFinger in-hand manipulation. As in Fig. 11(a), the
three-fingered robotic hand faces down and each finger has
3 DoFs, actuated with low-level joint PD controllers with
proportional gain Kp  10 and damping gain Kd  0.05.
Allegro hand on-palm reorientation. An Fig. 11(b), the
four-fingered hand faces up and each finger has 4 DoFs. We
implemented a low-level joint PD controller for each finger
with control gains: Kp  1 and Kd  0.05.
All tasks use MuJoCo as simulation environments. The pro-
posed complementarity-free model (23) is only used in MPC
for planning optimization.
Fig. 11: (a) TriFinger in-hand manipulation. (b) 4-Fingered Allegro
hand on-palm reorientation. Both simulation environments are built
using MuJoCo .
In each environment, we focus on dexterous manipulation
of 17 objects with diverse geometries, shown in Fig. 1. The
object meshes are from the ContactDB dataset , with some
proportional scaling to fit the workspace of the two hands.
Object diameters range from 50 mm to 150 mm. In both

versatility of our complementarity-free MPC, we use the same
object-related parameters in our model across environments
and objects, despite varying physical properties. The model
settings are listed in Table VI.
