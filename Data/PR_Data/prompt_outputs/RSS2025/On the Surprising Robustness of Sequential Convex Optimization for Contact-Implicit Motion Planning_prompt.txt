AbstractContact-implicit motion planningembedding con-

the promise of leveraging continuous optimization to discover new
contact patterns online. Nevertheless, the resulting optimization,
being an instance of Mathematical Programming with Comple-
mentary Constraints, fails the classical constraint qualifications
that are crucial for the convergence of popular numerical
solvers. We present robust contact-implicit motion planning with
sequential convex programming (CRISP), a solver that departs
from the usual primal-dual algorithmic framework but instead
focuses only on the primal problem. CRISP solves a convex
quadratic program with an adaptive trust region radius at each
using weighted 1 penalty. We (i) prove sufficient conditions on
CRISPs convergence to first-order stationary points of the merit
function; (ii) release a high-performance C implementation of
CRISP with a generic nonlinear programming interface; and (iii)
demonstrate CRISPs surprising robustness in solving contact-
implicit planning with naive initializations. In fact, CRISP solves
several contact-implicit problems with an all-zero initialization.
I. INTRODUCTION
Robots must intelligently establish and disengage contacts
to successfully perform complex tasks in the physical world,
such as manipulation of daily objects and locomotion in rough
terrains. However, the hybrid nature of combining continuous
dynamics with discrete contact events, the discontinuities in
force profiles, and the potential for stick-slip transitions, make
it notoriously difficult to plan through contact.
Contact-implicit motion planning. Among the many ef-
forts for motion planning through contact (see V for a
review), the so-called contact-implicit formulation stood out
as a particularly popular and promising approach [47, 62].
This formulation distinguishes itself by integrating contact
dynamics into the motion planning framework through the in-
troduction of complementarity constraints, which allow simul-
taneous optimization of the state-control trajectories and the
contact forces without explicit (and discrete) mode switching
(cf. (6)). However, the contact-implicit formulation circum-

vents explicit mode switching at the price of arriving at an
optimization problem known as Mathematical Programming
with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). Although they
look like smooth and continuous optimization problems,
MPCC problems are known to fail the classical constraint
qualifications (CQs) at all feasible points (e.g., Linear Inde-
pendence Constraint Qualification and Mangasarian-Fromovitz
Constraint Qualification) [48, 49, 61]. To make this concrete,
we provide the geometric intuition through a simple MPCC
problem.
Example 1 (Geometric Intuition of MPCC). Consider the
following two-dimensional MPCC problem:
(x1,x2)R2 f(x) : x2
subject to g1(x) : x1 0,
where (1d) is a complementarity constraint. As depicted
in Fig. 2, the objective level sets are circles in R2, and the
feasible set consists of the union of the two coordinate axes
in the first quadrant
The optimal solution of problem (1) lies at the origin (0, 0).
To understand the local geometry at the origin, we need to
characterize two types of cones around the origin.
(a) The tangent cone (TC) at a point is defined as the set of
tangent vectors of all curves approaching the point from the
feasible region . Thus, the tangent cone at (0, 0) is:
This consists of two directions: one along the positive x1-axis
and one along the positive x2-axis, see Fig. 2.
(b) The linearized feasible cone (LFC) is formed by all
active constraints at that point :
i.e., the entire first quadrant. Therefore, we conclude that
TC LFCthe TC is a strict subset of the LFC at (0, 0).
We remark that the TC is geometric, while the LFC
is algebraic. While the definition of LFC involves the
algebraic constraints and their linearizations, the definition
of TC characterizes the local geometry regardless of how the
feasible set is algebraically parameterized.
After noticing the gap between the TC and the LFC, the
reader might wonder why this is a problem. The reason lies
in that, the equivalence of TC and LFCtypically ensured by
CQsis a prerequisite to establish the KarushKuhnTucker
(KKT) conditions for local optimality . Moreover, al-
most all primal-dual nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers
(e.g., SNOPT , IPOPT ) rely on the KKT optimality
conditionsthey search for a pair of primal and dual variables
satisfying the KKT conditions. Therefore, the inherent absence
of CQs and the gap between TC and LFC of the MPCC
problems break the theoretical foundations for primal-dual
algorithms. The numerical consequence of this, as we will
show in IV, is that primal-dual solvers can exhibit poor
instabilities when solving contact-implicit MPCC problems.
Relaxation? An extensively studied strategy to mitigate the
failure of CQs is to relax the complementarity constraint.
the complementarity constraint (1d) as x1  x2   for  > 0.
In [49, 50], a different relaxation scheme where x1x2  for
> 0 is proposed. In both relaxations, CQs are restored (i.e.,
no gap between the TC and the LFC) and KKT optimality
conditions are reassured. However, since   0 is the original
non-relaxed problem we want to solve, a homotopy scheme
is needed to start with  very large and gradually push
to zero. There are two issues with the relaxation approach.
instead of just one, making this approach computationally
expensive. Second, while the problem with  very large
is generally well conditioned, as  0, numerical issues
appear again. For these reasons, to the best of our knowledge,
there does not exist a well-accepted implementation of the
relaxation approach. Recently in robotics,  targeted at
linear complementarity constraintswhich are indeed KKT
optimality conditions of a lower-level convex quadratic pro-
gram (QP)and designed a bilevel optimization algorithm
where the lower-level QP is solved in a differentiable way
to provide gradient for the upper-level trajectory optimization
problem. Crucially, to ensure the QP is differentiable with
respect to contact, relaxation (or smoothing) is applied again,
but this time to the interior point algorithm used for solving the
QP. However, (a) it is unclear whether the approach extends
to nonlinear complementarity constraints studied in our paper;
and (b) the implementation provided by  does not follow
a generic nonlinear programming interface. Therefore, we did
not benchmark against  in IV.
Can we solve contact-implicit motion planning in a numer-
ically robust way, without relaxation?
Contributions. The answer is rather discouraging if consid-
ering a generic nonconvex MPCC problem, as highlighted by
the mathematical optimization literature [20, 22, 21]. Never-
a unique property: the objective function is often convex (and
quadratic), as the goal typically involves tracking a trajectory
or reaching a target. Formally, we consider the problem:
subject to
ci(v, ) 0, i I
ci(v, )  0, i E
where v includes the trajectory of both robot state and control
associated with contact forces. We assume the objective func-
tion J(v, ) is convexusually a quadratic loss function of
tracking errors and control efforts. Constraint (6b) represents
the nonlinear system dynamics. Constraints (6c) and (6d)
are general inequality and equality constraints. The nonlin-
ear complementarity constraint (6e) enforces the relationship
between  and the nonlinear function (v, ). The expression
(x, )  should be interpreted as i(x, )  i  0, or
its equivalent form i(x, )  i 0 as suggested by ,
for every entry of () and . It should be emphasized that
problem (6) is nonlinear and nonconvex, as we impose no re-
strictions on the convexity of the constraints. This formulation
is classified as a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP)
due to constraints (6e). A key distinction between NCP and
linear complementarity problem (LCP) lies in the nonlinearity
present in both the complementarity constraints and other
constraints. While one can use s  (v, ) to recast com-
plementarity constraints as  s, this transformation merely
shifts the nonlinearity to the additional constraint s  (v, ).
In the linear complementarity problem (LCP) literature, both
and other constraints are typically required to be linear (as
in  and LCQpow ). In contrast, CRISP is capable of
handling generic nonlinear dynamics, as demonstrated in our
examples. We will give concrete examples of (6) in IV. For
Our major contribution is to depart from the usual primal-
dual algorithmic frameworkdue to the failure of CQs in
MPCCand propose a primal-only algorithm named CRISP
(Robust Contact-Implicit motion planning with Sequential
convex Programming). CRISP features a merit function with
weighted 1 penalty to measure primal feasibility and objective
reduction. It solves a series of trust-region convex quadratic
programs (QPs) formulated using local second-order infor-
mation of the objective and first-order information of the
constraints. In stark contrast with the well-known sequential
