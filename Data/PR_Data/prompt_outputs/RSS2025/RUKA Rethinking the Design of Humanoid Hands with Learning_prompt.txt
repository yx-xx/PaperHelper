AbstractDexterous manipulation is a fundamental capability
for robotic systems, yet progress has been limited by hardware
trade-offs between precision, compactness, strength, and afford-
ability. Existing control methods impose compromises on hand
designs and applications. However, learning-based approaches
present opportunities to rethink these trade-offs, particularly to
address challenges with tendon-driven actuation and low-cost
materials. This work presents RUKA, a tendon-driven humanoid
hand that is compact, affordable, and capable. Made from 3D-
printed parts and off-the-shelf components, RUKA has 5 fingers
with 15 underactuated degrees of freedom enabling diverse
human-like grasps. Its tendon-driven actuation allows powerful
grasping in a compact, human-sized form factor. To address
control challenges, we learn joint-to-actuator and fingertip-to-
actuator models from motion-capture data collected by the
MANUS glove, leveraging the hands morphological accuracy.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate RUKAs superior reachability,
operation tasks further showcase RUKAs dexterous movements.

I. INTRODUCTION
Achieving dexterity similar to human hands is essential for
performing daily human tasks . In recent years, signifi-
cant progress has been made in robotics toward developing
autonomous dexterous policies [18, 17, 35, 21]. Many of
these advances have been achieved through learning-based ap-
learning methods using teleoperated robot demonstrations [36,
are now being applied in dexterous, multimodal [51, 5], and
long-horizon [48, 7] tasks.
While these achievements are remarkable, progress has been
limited by hardware. An ideal robotic hand must balance
requirements remain challenging to achieve simultaneously,
so existing hand designs have needed to make trade-offs
based on the available control methods and target applica-
tions. To prioritize precision, some hands integrate motors
with encoders directly in their joints, but this significantly

increases the hands size and weight [44, 1]. To prioritize
compactness and strength, other hands adopt a tendon-driven
design with actuators outside the hand [43, 11], but this
introduces nonlinearities, elasticities, and uncertainties into the
force transmission system, making it challenging to model
how actuators affect joint angles and fingertip positions. This
challenge can be addressed to an extent by incorporating small
position encoders into the hand , but this is expensive,
prone to mechanical failure, and difficult to repair.

and actuation technologies. However, we argue that learning-
based approaches present an opportunity to rethink some of
these trade-offs, particularly to tackle the challenges associated
with tendon-driven actuation using low-cost materials.
In this work, we introduce RUKA, a tendon-driven humanoid
hand that is simple, affordable, and capable. Made from 3D-
printed parts and off-the-shelf components, it takes approx-
imately 7 hours to assemble and costs under 1300 USD.
RUKA has 5 fingers, including an opposable thumb, with
dimensions matching the average human hand. These fea-
tures enable smoother learning from human demonstrations
and integrating into human environments. Its 15 degrees of
freedom (DOFs) are driven by 11 actuators housed in the
forearm and connected to finger linkages using flexible ten-
dons. This tendon-driven actuation allows for diverse, human-
To tackle the associated control challenges, we use learning-
based techniques to develop fingertip-to-actuator and joint-
to-actuator models that predict the actuation commands re-
quired to produce target fingertip and joint positions. Training
these models involves two key ideas: (1) We fit MANUS
gloves off-the-shelf motion-capture gloves designed for
human handsonto our robot hands to collect fingertip and
joint positions without using joint encoders. This crucially
leverages our hands morphological similarity to human hands.
(2) We autonomously collect labeled data points in the form
of (fingertipjoint position, actuation command) pairs by pro-
cedurally sampling actuation commands within motor limits.
This method captures the broad dataset needed for the models
to learn these nonlinear relationships.
We extensively evaluate RUKA against popular robotic
hands and demonstrate its superior reachability, durability,
and strength. We further apply RUKA in teleoperation tasks
and show that it can perform dexterous movements. The key
contributions of this work are:
1) RUKA provides an open-source design for a tendon-
driven robotic hand that can be built for under 1,300.
2) RUKA introduces a data-driven control approach that
leverages MANUS motion-capture gloves for data col-
lection and learned controllers for fingertip positions and
joint angles to support applications like teleoperation.

II. RELATED WORK
A. Robotic Hands
Direct-driven robotic hands like the LEAP  and Allegro
are popular in research due to their low cost and precise
control using motors located directly in the joints. Despite
its 15,000 price, the Allegro hand has only four fingers,
overheats easily, and is hard to repair. The LEAP hand
improves endurance and repairability but, like other direct-
drive designs, remains oversized and not human-like.
Tendon-driven hands with external actuators address these
Hand  are costly and require complex repairs. Open-source
easier repairs but often lack infrastructure and precise control.
Soft robotic hands offer many advantages, including com-
pliance and more natural grasps. The RBO3 hand is a soft,
pneumatically actuated design that, while beneficial, is less
precise and difficult to simulate due to its flexibility .
The ADAPT hand addresses this with a rigid link structure,
compliant joints, and a compliant skin . Though both
hands are robust, neither is open-source or available to buy.
Biomimetic hand designs, which mimic the exact tendon
actuation of a human hand, are often extremely complex but
robust. Hands such as the FLLEX hand  and the hand
in Xu et al.  use complex pulley systems and custom
parts. They are highly precise while remaining compliant.

it an effective research tool.

The Shadow Hand  features joint encoders for closed-loop
on tendon displacement.
When kinematics and proprioception are ill-defined, as
in soft and tendon-driven hands, prior work has turned to
data-driven approaches for learning controllers. While these
methods have achieved great success in policy learning for
dexterous manipulation [18, 17, 19, 20, 8, 35, 9], applying
them to controller learning remains challenging due to diffi-
culties in collecting ground-truth supervised data.
Existing approaches [16, 41, 42, 44] rely on infrared sen-
capture gloves have also been used to collect human motion
data [42, 4], which is then retargeted to robots via AR tags or
video-based pose estimation. However, these approaches are
limited by their dependence on the wearers morphology and
the need for carefully curated training poses.
Inspired by these methods, RUKA also follows a data-driven
approach for learning controllers. However, unlike prior work,
we enable large-scale autonomous data collection by fitting a
motion-capture glove directly to the robotic hand, simplifying
the process of gathering supervised data.
III. HARDWARE DESIGN
A. Design Principles
The RUKA hand is designed for functionality and accessi-
bility while balancing anthropomorphism, cost, and reliability.
1) Morphologically Accurate: The RUKA hand mimics
human morphology to enable tool use and direct application of
human hand data. True anthropomorphism requires more than
matching degrees of freedomit demands accurate size, finger
and Allegro  match human degrees of freedom, they often
fall short in form with fewer fingers and oversized designs. In
the need for retargeting human data, allowing for seamless
interaction with tools and everyday objects.
2) Low-Cost: Existing morphologically accurate robotic

printed parts and off-the-shelf components. The total cost of
the raw materials needed, excluding tools (a 3D-printer and
soldering iron), is under 500
and 900 version of RUKA with varying Dynamixel motors.
3) Reliability: For RUKA to serve as a reliable research
erate for long durations without degradation, and be easily
repairable. Rigid hinge joints are needed for repeatability, as
compliance in actuation mechanisms can introduce uncertainty
. However, to balance rigidity with functional flexibility, we
added soft pads to the fingers, improving task performance
while maintaining durability. Additionally, the hands open-
source design allows for quick, in-house repairs, ensuring
minimal downtime. The Dynamixel motors  allow for
accurate positioning, and the motor case has ventilation to pre-
vent overheating during long runtimes. To ensure consistency
across builds, we avoid construction methods that introduce
4) Open-Source: RUKA is fully open-source, with its 3D
design and software freely available. Hands like Inmoov
lack editable CAD files, making design modification difficult.
RUKA is designed in OnShape, allowing easy sharing and
editing of CAD files. The control code and a MuJoCo model
of the hand is available on GitHub. Open-source hardware
is cheap, adaptable, and fosters collaboration among users
and developers. However, it is also important to ensure easy
assembly for inexperienced users and maintain documentation
. We provide step-by-step assembly instructions and repair
guides. Assembling RUKA takes approximately 7 hours, and
most repairs take under 20 minutes.
B. Kinematics
The RUKA hand is designed with 15 degrees of freedom
and 11 actuators. The thumb is actuated by 3 motors, 1
for each joint, while the other 4 fingers each use 2 actua-
interphalangeal (DIP) joints together (Fig. 3). Although the

and dark blue respectively) are responsible for flexion, while the springs are responsible for extension.
hand is underactuated, previous studies on robotic hands
have demonstrated that underactuation can provide robust and
reliable functionality while significantly reducing weight and
mechanical complexity [26, 34, 39, 29, 45]. In human hands,
DIP and PIP are rarely actuated independently , so RUKA
actuates these joints with a single tendon per finger.
The metacarpophalangeal (MCP) or knuckle joint in human
fingers is a ball joint, but for simplicity and rigidity, it is
modeled as a revolute joint in RUKA fingers. To replicate the
functions of the MCP joint, two rotations are applied to the
knuckle where the joint attaches. The first rotation creates a
fully open, allowing them to converge naturally as the hand
second rotation mimics the curve of human knuckles, which
originates from the carpometacarpal (CMC) joints (Fig. 3). A
concave curvature is applied to the palm and knuckles and is
enhanced by slightly rotating the fingers inward toward each
other. These adaptations improve the hands ability to achieve
grasps dependent on the MCP (Fig. 7).
The thumbs kinematics are also simplified while re-
taining critical functionality. A human thumb typically has

RUKA thumb is modeled with three degrees of freedom with
three joints to simplify control while optimizing grasping
performance (Fig. 3), with the ranges of motion described in
Table II. The carpometacarpal (CMC) joint handles opposition.
The metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint controls abduction and
adduction and is oriented 90 degrees relative to the first joint.
The interphalangeal (IP) joint controls flexion and extension,
rotated 45 degrees toward the palm relative to the second joint.
This configuration mimics the orientation of these joints in the
natural position of the thumb.

C. Materials and Fabrication
1) 3D-Printed Parts: The hands parts are 3D-printed in
24 hours using the Bambu Lab X1C . The finger joints,
for its rigidity and ease of printing. The compliant pads for
the fingers and palm are printed in FilaFlex Foamy TPU .
These pads are then attached using glue, and 3M friction tape
is applied on top for additional grip.
2) Off-The-Shelf Components: Heat-set inserts are used to
securely assemble the printed parts, allowing the components
to be fastened with screws. These inserts are pressed into
the printed parts using a soldering iron. Metal dowels are
used for the pin joints, which are spring-loaded open with
an extension spring. The tendons are made of braided fishing
line rated for 200 lbs, selected for its combination of strength
and flexibility. The line is secured to the printed components
using a slip knot, routed through the finger mechanism and
a PTFE tube in the palm, which guides it to the motor. The
low-friction properties of PTFE significantly reduce resistance
during tendon movement, ensuring smooth operation. This
routing system is highly adaptable, as the only fixed points
are the start and end of the PTFE tubes, allowing for easy
adjustments and reconfiguration.
3) Actuators: The actuators are Dynamixel XM430-W210-
T motors for the thumb and Dynamixel XL330-M288-T mo-
tors  for the other fingers. Higher torque motors are used
for the thumb. Communication with the motors is achieved
through a USB-to-serial bridge. The motors are powered by
a 12V and 5V dual-output power supply and connected via a
custom wiring harness.
IV. HARDWARE EVALUATION
We run a variety of tests that assess RUKA hands capa-
bilities and robustness. Specifically, we test its reachability,
A. Reachability Tests
1) Kapandji Test: We evaluate the classical Kapandji test
. RUKA scores 1010 for all poses, while the Allegro and
LEAP hands each score 910, losing a point due to having
fewer fingers.
2) Range of Motion Test: We evaluate the joint ranges of
motion (Table II). We also evaluate the thumbs opposition ca-
pabilities by randomly sampling 250,000 joint configurations
for the thumb and each finger and recording instances where
the fingertips touch (Fig. 4).
3) Grasp Test: We evaluate the 33 standard grasps from
the GRASP Taxonomy . RUKA successfully reproduces
29 out of 33 human hand grasps, as shown in Fig. 7. The
hand is able to reach grasps that rely on MCP adduction and
thumb degrees of freedom that are underactuated.

fingertips overlayed on the hand. This demonstrates the large set of
opposable grasps possible with RUKA.
B. Durability Tests
Durability is essential for a usable research robot. When
robot hands run continuously for more than an hour, issues
arise like motor overheating and declining hand precision.
This means researchers cannot run continuous tasks for long
to run the RUKA hand for 20 hours continuously, without
a significant drop in motor precision. With 20 hours as a
lower bound, RUKA outperforms both Allegro  and LEAP
hands. We also recorded the motor temperatures over
90 minutes. Even run continuously, the temperatures stabilize
below the maximum rating, allowing for long run times
(Fig. 5).

average force across leftright hands is reported in Table III.
2) Payload Test: We actuate the PIP and DIP joints on the
non-thumb fingers to curl around the handle of a cloth bag, to
which we add weight until any joint angle error exceeds 15
degrees. The final weight is reported in Table III.
3) Slip Test: We actuate joints in combination to hold a
hanging scale measuring force, to which we add weight until
the joint angle error exceeds 15 degrees. We test the force
supported by the combined DIPPIP joints and the MCP joints
of non-thumb fingers. The Inmoov hand  only has one
actuator per finger, so DIPPIP and MCP slip force cannot be
measured; instead, the whole finger is measured jointly. The
average force across the 4 fingers is reported in Table III.
D. Analysis
RUKA has the highest performance across all strength
metrics. The LEAP Hand  uses the same Dynamixel
motors  as RUKA, with three per finger instead of two
for flexion. This suggests RUKAs improved performance over
LEAP is primarily due to its tendon-driven design, which
removes actuator weight from the fingers. When compared
to Inmoov , which is open-source and lower cost than
capacity of 87.5 and a 64.21 improvement in the slip test.
This performance gain is primarily due to Inmoovs single-
actuator finger design and lower-torque motors. While Inmoov
achieves a similar pinch force to RUKA, this is mainly due
to Inmoovs complaint silicone fingertips, as it is only able to
exert 57.4 of force without the silicone tips. These results
show that lightweight, tendon-driven designs offer significant
advantages in performance.
V. CONTROLLER
The tendon-driven approach to hand design offers signif-
icant advantages, including durability and a compact form

hands. However, this introduces challenges in control. The
absence of a direct mapping between motor positions and
fingertip positions or joint angles makes it difficult to apply
standard control techniques commonly used in robotics [2, 25].
In RUKA, we find the best of both worlds by employing a
data-driven approach, achieving a balance between a compact,
durable form and simplified control. We illustrate our frame-
work involving the data collection process and controller learn-
ing architecture (Figure 8). This section provides a detailed
explanation of our data collection process and the learning
methodology used for the hand controls.
A. Autonomous Data Collection
To effectively utilize a learning-based approach, we first
integrate the MANUS Haptic Gloves  with RUKA using
a custom 3D-printed attachment that secures the gloves to the
back of the hand, along with the fingertip attachments provided
by MANUS. The gloves track fingertip motion using magnetic
field sensors paired with small embedded magnets. As the
fingers move, the gloves provide real-time fingertip positions,
represented as ft R53, along with keypoint data estimating
the full hand pose, kt R5K3, where K  5 denotes the
number of keypoints per finger.
Once the gloves are attached, we initiate autonomous data
collection by performing a random walk over uniformly sam-
pled motor positions within their respective limits. For each
described in Section III, the thumb is actuated by three motors,
whereas each of the other four fingers is actuated by two
motors. To ensure coverage of the entire action space, we
repeat this process 500 times for the thumb and 300 times
for each of the other four fingers.
During data collection, we compute joint angles by tak-
ing the dot product between vectors connecting consecutive
keypoints. Throughout data collection, we record fingertip

actual motor positions at 15 Hz.
B. Controller Learning
1) Implementation Details: After data collection, we train a
separate controller for each finger. Each controller predicts the
corresponding motor positions based on the desired fingertip
position for the thumb, and joint angles for the other fingers.
This distinction is necessary because (a) the thumb joints differ
between the human and the robot, and (b) MANUS outputs
different fingertip representations for the human and the robot
for the other four fingers.
We illustrate the controller learning architecture in Fig.8.
To incorporate temporal information, we use a simple Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  network as a sequential
a sequential representation. The final output from the LSTM
is then passed to an MLP head to predict the next motor
position. The loss between the predicted and ground truth
motor positions is computed using mean squared error (MSE)
and optimized with the AdamW  optimizer.
2) Experiments:
We explore different architectures, in-
putoutput types, and learning parameters to optimize perfor-
mance. In this section, we present our results on different data-
driven controllers and the evaluations we conducted. Our ex-
periments aim to answer the following questions: (a) How do
architecture choices and learning parameters affect controller
performance? (b) How do the trained controllers transfer to
new hands?
We evaluate our approach on two separate test datasets:
Human Validation: A human wears the MANUS glove,
moves their hand into various poses, and the keypoints
are recorded during this motion.
Robot Validation: The MANUS glove is attached to
the robot, and the robots fingertips are manually moved
while recording data from the MANUS stream, as illus-
trated in the top row of Fig. 9.
During evaluation for both datasets, we attach the glove
to the robot and replay the recorded keypoints by moving
the robot motors to the positions predicted by the controllers.
We then record the robots keypoints and measure accuracy
by comparing the reproduced fingertip positions against the
originally saved ones.
How do architecture choices and learning parameters
affect controller performance?
After we collected data as described in Section V-A, we
experiment on four different ways to train controllers.

as described in Sec. V-B1.
directly input the current fingertip position and predict
the motor position.

metric model, we use k-nearest neighbor retrieval on the
desired fingertip positions and apply the mean of those

Search Based
MLP and search-based baselines perform significantly worse,
with errors reaching up to 2cm on certain axes. Although the k-
NN baseline outperforms the RUKA architecture on the Robot
Validation set, it underperforms on the Human Validation set.
We attribute this to the out-of-distribution nature of human
fingertip positions, which the k-NN baseline fails to generalize
to effectively.
How do the trained controllers transfer to new hands?
Since RUKA is a tendon-driven hand that can be assembled
by different users, the way its tendons are tensioned may
vary from user to user. To maintain the usability of RUKA
across different builds, the learned controllers should be able
to generalize to these variations.
To enable this, we implement an auto-calibration script that
estimates the maximum range of each motor given the current
tendon tensioning. The script perfo
