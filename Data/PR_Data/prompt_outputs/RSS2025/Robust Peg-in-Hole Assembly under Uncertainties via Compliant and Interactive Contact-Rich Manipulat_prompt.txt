exceed the allowed clearance. In this paper, we study how to lever-
age contact between the peg and its matching hole to eliminate
uncertainties in the assembly process under unstructured settings.
By examining the role of compliance under contact constraints,
we present a manipulation system that plans collision-inclusive
interactions for the peg to 1) iteratively identify its task envi-

without relying on precise perception, enabling a robust solution

present a formal approach to constructing manipulation funnels

I. INTRODUCTION
Robotic peg-in-hole assembly is a foundational skill in
various industrial applications and beyond, involving inserting
a peg into its matching hole on another object under tight clear-
ances . Common strategies seek to optimize the insertion
trajectory under certain conditions, either through explicitly
modeling the task environment or formulating the problem
as a POMDP  (partially observable Markov decision
process) to enable reactive policies based on sensory input.
Regardless of the debate on how accurately a model describes
manipulation lies in the execution . It is the execution
that brings the optimized result from planning into the real
world through motor actuation by the controller. However,
real-world perception challenges and physical uncertainties,
such as those arising from hardware limitations, can introduce
small deviations between planned and executed trajectories.
Under the tight tolerance of peg-in-hole assembly, even minor
uncertainties can lead to undesired manipulation outcomes.
effort to tackle real-world uncertainties beyond solely planned
trajectories.
Acknowledging that planned trajectories are rarely executed
perfectly in the real world due to uncertainties, focusing on
the outcomes of interactions between the system and the
environment [15, 14], rather than on explicit trajectories, offers
a promising approach to achieving robust manipulation. This
formulation often requires the role of compliance, either from
mechanical design [12, 42] or computational simulation ,
to passively adapt to external contacts. Rather than causing
undesired outcomes, environmental constraints can shape the
compliant manipulation process toward the desired outcome
under deliberate exploitation , even without elaborate con-
tact models [44, 8]. With this insight, we propose leveraging
the contacts between the peg and its matching hole as an
advantage to eliminate uncertainties for ne insertions.
In this paper, we introduce a manipulation system (shown
in Fig. 1) that plans compliant interactions between the
manipulated peg and its task environment to identify and
exploit contact constraints for robust insertion. Safe contact
is ensured by impedance control , which allows external
contact to alter the pose of the peg by mimicking a spring-
damper behavior. Since the steady pose of the peg after
each interaction is observable and is a combined effect of
the environmental constraints and potential from impedance
to shrink the target holes proposal distribution progressively
and 2) exploit the environmental constraints to shape the
motion of the peg to enter its matching hole. Specically,
the exploitation process involves maintaining constant contact
between the peg and the hole to serve as motion constraints.
Since the environmental constraints can shape a large margin
of uncertainties and the interaction mechanism of force-pose
regulation is independent of the specic trajectory taken, the
proposed system can tolerate uncertainties smaller than its
execution precision, even under tight tolerances.
As the system dynamics progressively eliminates uncer-
tainty in perception and execution, we formulate the proposed
system as a composition of manipulation funnels in different
state spaces. The original concept of the manipulation funnel
was introduced by Mason  to eliminate uncertainties in ob-
ject location, emphasizing that the robustness of funnel-based
manipulation requires the co-design of robot interaction and
task mechanics. A general formulation of the funneling process
can be dened in any task-relevant space as a progressive
space shrinkage for uncertainty elimination. Inspired by the
planar theory of automatic motion synthesis , we establish
a formal approach to constructing manipulation funnels for
robust ne insertion of general prismatic pegs in the real world.
The primary contributions of this paper are:
We present an uncertainty-absorbing paradigm for general
peg-in-hole insertion based on the concept of manipula-
tion funnel, which does not plan on the explicit trajecto-
ries but rather the outcome of each compliant interaction.
We present a formal approach to constructing the funnel-
ing process for both perception and execution, which can
be further composed for general peg-in-hole insertion.
We provide a system with detailed algorithms to imple-
ment the above funnel-based manipulation paradigm on
real-world assembly tasks.
We conduct ablation studies through extensive experi-
ments on a standard assembly benchmark NIST ATB and
additional challenging tasks to validate the robustness and
generalizability of the proposed paradigm and system.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
reviews related works. Section III introduces the preliminaries
and problem statement for funnel-based manipulation planning
in peg-in-hole assembly. Section IV introduces the task me-
chanics and presents a formal approach to constructing manip-
ulation funnels in perception and execution. Section V demon-
strates the robustness of the proposed system in simulation
and real-world experiments. We discuss the limitations under
current settings in Section VI and summarize the contributions
in Section VII.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Peg-in-Hole Assembly
Over the past decade, pipeline-based and end-to-end ap-
proaches have driven advancements in robotic peg-in-hole
systems. Pipeline-based approaches aim to explicitly esti-
mate intermediate system states for motion planning. Previous
works [25, 51, 27] leverage tactile or forcetorque sensors
for contact state estimation. Vision-based methods [54, 21]
estimate alignment deviations for correction or search motion
planning. This modular design provides interpretability and
data-driven methods. In contrast, end-to-end approaches
aim at deriving an implicit function to map sensory inputs to
motor skills from trial-and-error. The entire system connects
feature extraction to planning in a unied manner [13, 37, 50,
ciple that assembly is a relative positioning task , as-
suming the robot will precisely execute the issued trajectory.
Our research targets a different perspective , as the ne
insertion motion is a passive renement process that exploits
environmental constraints.
B. Compliance-enabled Manipulation
Compliance

through passive adaptability. The role of compliance in robot
manipulation often involves compensation for uncertainty
and safe interaction with the environment, which has been
adopted in a wide range of tasks, including dexterous grasp-
ing [6, 33, 12], in-hand manipulation [32, 41, 2], grasp
adaptation [31, 19, 26], assembly [40, 38, 55] and human-
robot co-manipulation [47, 43].
environmental constraints to eliminate uncertainties, ensuring
robust and dexterous manipulation [14, 20, 11, 46, 56, 23, 7].
In this work, we propose a formal approach for compliance-
enabled contact between the peg and the hole to eliminate
uncertainty in insertion motions.
C. Funnel-based Manipulation
Mason  proposed the original concept of manipulation
funnels to eliminate uncertainties based on task mechanics
and task-specic interaction. The importance of exploiting
task mechanics to eliminate uncertainties is also revealed in
concepts such as pre-image  and backprojections .
Early works have applied funnel-based designs in manipula-
tion tasks, including ball batting , part orienting [18, 17] and
et al.  investigated funnel-based action primitives for in-
hand manipulation through an empirical study. Canberk et al.
proposes canonicalized-alignment as task mechanics to
funnel the large space of possible cloth congurations into a
The major challenges in developing funnel-based manipu-
lation lie twofold: 1) formulating the general task mechanics
for a given manipulation task and 2) dening task-specic
interaction beyond hardware-associated control. To tackle the
above challenges in real-world peg-in-hole tasks, we provide
a general formulation of the task mechanics of peg-in-hole
insertion and an object-centric interaction mechanism, which
is not dependent on any specic hardware.
III. PRELIMINARIES AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this work, we consider the peg-in-hole assembly problem
as inserting a peg into its matching hole on a planar board
surface as illustrated in Fig. 2-(a). We aim to plan compliant
motions of a manipulated peg that frequently makes and breaks
contact with its task environment, rst to perceive the location
of the matching hole on the task board and then insert the peg
into it under tight clearance.
A. Preliminaries
1) Geometry of the Peg and Hole: The 3-dimensional (3-
D) geometry of the hole is described in the hole reference
frame {H}, as an intrusion of a 2-D polygonal base dened
by an ordered sequence of vertices Vh  (v0
R3 is the corresponding unordered set of the Vh. The intrusion
is along the negative direction of the Z-axis of {H}. Vh
denes a planar region Ah R3 on the XY -plane of {H}
Ah  {(x, y, z) R3  fAh(x, y) 0 z  0}
where fAh(x, y) is an implicit distance function to describe
the boundary of Ah as fAh(x, y)  0 and its interior area as
fAh(x, y) < 0, exterior area as fAh(x, y) > 0.
The 3-D geometry of the peg is described in the peg
reference frame {E}, as an extrusion of a 2-D polygon
base Ve  (v0
e ), ve R3, zve  0 on the XY -
plane of {E}. Its corresponding unordered set is denoted as
S(Ve)  n
e} R3.The extrusion is along the positive
direction of Z-axis of {E}, and Ve is considered approximated
equal to Vh but dened in different frames.
2) Task Environment: We specify the Cartesian world
frame {O} attached to the task board, as its XY -plane is
aligned with the board surface and its orthogonal Z-axis points
outward the task board. The pose of the hole in the world
frame is denoted as T{OH} SE(3). We describe the task

which is dened as follows:

z > 0 (z 0 fT{OH}Ah(x, y) < 0)

in which 1 denotes occupied by the task board, 0 denotes
on the surface of the task board, and 1 denotes the free space.
An initial area of interest Aboard R3 is specied on the
XY -plane of {O} that guarantees T{OH}Ah Aboard.
3) Compliant Interactions for the Peg: As the peg is in a
prism-shaped geometry as dened in Sec. III-A1, we use the
densely sampled points Pe  {pi
i1 on the edges of
the peg for collision checking (considered continuous along
the lateral and base edges), in which pe  (x, y, z) is in the
Cartesian coordinates of {E}. The sampled points are assumed
to be rigidly attached to each other, as the entire point set
undergoes the same rigid body transformation (rotation and
translation). The pose of frame {E} with reference to frame
{O} at time t is represented as xt  [p; r] R6, in which
p R3 is the position vector and r R3 is the orientation
represented with Euler angle. The target peg-in-hole state is
denoted as x. The corresponding transformation matrix of
xt is denoted as T{OE},t SE(3). An overview of the task
environment with the manipulated peg is illustrated in Fig. 2-
To enable safe contact between the peg and its task envi-
desired state xd
t R6 at time t. A wrench F R6 (consisting
of 3-D force and torque) is applied to the peg by a Cartesian
impedance controller as formulated:
F  Kd(xd
t xt) Dd xt
in which Kd R66 is the diagonal stiffness matrix to
decouple compliance in each degree of freedom, Dd R66
is the damping matrix for movement stabilizing and xt R6
is the velocity of {E} with reference to {O} at time t.
An interaction command ct  (xt, xd
t) at time t is dened
by its starting state xt (considered steady as xt  0) and a
desired state xd
t. A compliant interaction xt1  (xt, xd
between the peg and its task environment is an unknown but
observable process  : R6  R6 7R6 from the starting state
xt to the next steady state xt1, under the drive of xd
t and the
environmental constraints in the frame of {O}. Except for the
virtually dened desired state xd
xt1 during this process is constrained by its task environment
as follows:
po T{OE},t1Pe, (xpo, ypo, zpo)  1
We do not explicitly predict or trace the trajectory of the peg
during this process but only observe its steady state at xt and
xt1. At the steady state xt1, any external contact wrench
Fext R6 in frame {O} is balanced by the pose deviation as:
Fext  Kd(xd
while the velocity xt1  0 of the peg remains zero.
We use the intersection point set Po,footprint,t R3 between
the pegs edges and the XY -plane of {O} at the steady pose
xt to describe the outcome of each interaction as:
task board.
B. Problem Statement
We formulate the peg-in-hole assembly task as a progressive
uncertainty elimination process in the state space of perception
and execution. We aim to plan interactions ct  (xt, xd
between the peg and its task environment to 1) iteratively re-
duce the uncertainty of the perception result of the target hole
and 2) nish the peg insertion under execution and perception
uncertainty. An overview of the peg-in-hole assembly process
is outlined in Alg. 1.
Perception State Space: We use eT{OH} to denote the esti-
mated state of the ground truth T{OH}. The estimation result
at time t is represented with a probabilistic density function
Pt( eT{OH}) bounded by a proposal region Xt SE(3), which
is dened as follows:
Pt( eT{OH})
eT{OH} Xt
eT{OH} Xt
where Xt denotes the volume of region Xt.
We aim to form a recursive sequence of proposal regions
based on the outcomes Po,footprint,t of each interaction ct:
X0 X1 X2    XT 1
As Xt shrinks over steps, the expected spread of eT{OH}
decreases and the uncertainty range of the perceived holes
state is reduced.
Execution Task Space: Let x R be the deviation
between the steady state xt and the peg-in-hole state x. Based
on the estimated state distribution of PT 1( eTOH), we aim to
shrink x at each step of interaction ct to progressively reach
the peg-in-hole conguration as follows:
We consider a successful peg-in-hole assembly when x
reaches zero.

IV. FUNNEL-BASED MANIPULATION PLANNING
A manipulation funnel represents a convergence process by
iterative contractions from a larger entrance to a smaller exit
state space, ensured by task-specic interactions. A general
funnel formulation is dened as Denition 4.1.
Denition 4.1. Let S be a task-relevant space that could
represent any system parameters. Given a target state s, we
aim to nd subspaces Sin S so that after applying some
state transition functions, denoted as  : S S, the resultant
output space Sout S is guaranteed to be strictly smaller than
the input space: Sin > Sout. If these conditions are satised
, sSin and sSout, a tuple F  (Sin, , Sout) is called
a manipulation funnel.
We rst dene the task-specic interactions based on the
task mechanics in Section IV-A. Then, we introduce the formal
approach to construct manipulation funnels in perception state
space (Section IV-B) and execution task space (Section IV-C).
A. Task Mechanics and Interaction Primitives
Funnel-based manipulation planning requires deep exploita-
tion of the intrinsic task mechanics . As perception and
physical uncertainties are inevitable , our key insight is
forming an aligned corner between the inclined peg and the
target hole to create contact constraints for undesired motion
freedoms and progressively enter the allowed clearance (as
illustrated in Fig. 3-(a)). A corner from the hole is dened
by arbitrary vertex vcorner
S(Vh) as the local angle vcorner
formed by vcorner
and its nearby edges from the interior side.
In this paper, we use the case of vcorner
<  for motion
funnel construction. However, theoretically, it also applies to
the case of vcorner
>  as long as the local convexity exists.

this local geometry enables the downstream iterative insertion

Despite the trajectory being a dominant action representa-
tion in manipulation planning, it is unsuitable for funnel-based
manipulations as interactions with the task environment are
allowed to alter the motion of the manipulator . Given the
target corner vcorner
of the hole, its corresponding vertex on the
base of the peg is denoted as pv  vcorner

cos() cos()
cos() sin()
Interaction with inclined states is designed to identify and
exploit its environmental contact constraints. Such a formu-
lation offers several advantages: 1) when the peg engages
with the task board from above (as illustrated in Fig. 4),
the observation Po,footprint,t is divided into binary categories
based on the cardinality of the set Po,footprint,t: whether it is
a contact point or an intersection area between the peg and
hole; 2) an inclined state relaxes the requirement for a peg to
be partially entered into the hole ; 3) before an insertion
task is nished (considered vertical w.r.t. the board surface
plane), all peg states can be described as inclined states during
the insertion process.
B. Perception Manipulation Funnel
The perception manipulation funnel aims to iteratively re-
duce the proposal region Xt of the target holes distribution
Pt( eT{OH}) through observation from each interaction. By
strategically placing the supporting vertex pv of the desired
state xd
t beneath the XY -plane of {O}, we can intentionally
capture the encountered contact constraints reected on the
resulted steady state xt1. As illustrated in Fig. 4, after each
an inequality constraint as dened in Denition 4.3 to limit
the distribution of eT{OH}.
Denition 4.3. An inequality constraint on the possible space
of eT{OH} is dened as gt( eT{OH}) 0 based on the observa-
tion Po,footprint,t, where gt( eT{OH}) is dened as:
po Po,footprint,t,
gt( eT{OH})
T{OH}Ah(po), Po,footprint,t  1
T{OH}Ah(po), Otherwise
in which  is the cardinality of the set. For a potential holes
state eT{OH}, any contact point (as Po,footprint,t  1) should
be excluded from the holes area, while any intersection area
(as Po,footprint,t > 1) should be fully contained by the holes
The proposal region at t  0 is derived from the initial area
of interest Aboard as follows:
X0  { eT{OH}  eT{OH}Ah Aboard}
The proposal region at step t is dened as:
Xt  { eT{OH} X0 SE(3)  gi( eT{OH}) 0, i  1, 2, ..., t}
which is updated at step t  1 with the new added constraint
gt1( eT{OH}) 0 as:
Xt1  Xt { eT{OH} SE(3)  gt1( eT{OH}) 0}

feasible region Xt is monotonically decreasing (Xt1 Xt)

As Xt shrinks over steps in Lemma 4.4, the expected spread
of eT{OH} decreases, and the allowable state space of the target
hole narrows.
Lemma 4.5. The ground truth state of the hole is always
included in the allowable state space as T{OH} Xt over
interactions cv

Since the proposal region Xt1 Xt of the target hole
is monotonically shrinking over interactions cv
the target state T{OH} is guaranteed to be contained by Xt
and Xt1, we introduce the perception manipulation funnel as
dened in Theorem 4.6.

lation funnel in the perception state space.
region Xt is shrinking and approaching T{OH} over random

funnel is established based on the general Denition 4.1
duced to improve convergence efciency. An overview is
outlined in Alg. 2. The probability distribution Pt( eT{OH}) of
the target holes state is dened by Eq. 7 and the initial area
for exploration Aboard is divided into grid points G  {gi
i  1, 2, ..., N} where gi R3 on the XY -plane of {O}.
During each interaction, number K of potential holes states
is sampled as { eT{OH},i}K
i1 Pt( eT{OH}). The probability
Pin that g is included by the target hole is dened by:
i1 h( eT{OH},i, g)
h( eT{OH}, g)
g eT{OH}Ah
Otherwise
Let H() represent the entropy of the given probabilistic
density function. The expected entropy reduction is formulated
H(g)  H(Pt( eT{OH})) E[H(Pt( eT{OH})  g)]
where E[H(Pt( eT{OH})  g)] is the expected entropy after
evaluating g. To maximize information gain, the desired state
should spatially overlap with the selected grid point gG
that maximizes H(g) for contact constraints identication:
g arg max
The convergence of the proposed entropy-based exploration is
proven in Theorem 4.6.

C. Physical Manipulation Funnel
The physical manipulation funnel aims to leverage envi-
ronmental contacts as physical constraints in the execution
task space to iteratively reduce x for peg-in-hole insertion.
Based on the task mechanics as Fig. 3-(a), we consider a
sequential process as 1) aligning an inclined state to its
corresponding corner and 2) adjusting the aligned inclined
state to insertion. All the states xt described in this section
are considered inclined states, which are dened by pv, ,
and  as introduced in Eq. (10) and (11). We describe
the spatial relationship between the xt and x(the target
peg-in-hole state) based on the Po,footprint,t and the target
corner vcorner
. Specically, Po,footprint,t forms a 2-D polygon
as Vo,footprint,t
corresponding area Ao,footprint,t R3 on the XY -plane of
{O}. The state deviation x is dened based on Vo,footprint,t
and vcorner
as Denition 4.7.

edge of the supporting vertex pv intersects with the XY -plane
of {O}, we project its state as  : R6 7R4. We use the

Fig. 5: (a) The pegs state xt is projected as [vlateral; lateral]. (b) By setting the translation deviation between the desired state xd
and the starting state xt only on the XY -plane of {O}, a 2-D potential energy eld is formulated. (c) The corner alignment
process is formulated as aligning the point vt  vlateral to the corner vj  vcorner
under the drive of the created potential energy
vlateral R3 and the angle value lateral R of vlateral to
describe the pose as (xt)  [vlateral; lateral], as illustrated in
Fig. 5-(a). vlateral is the intersection point between the lateral
edge of pv and the XY -plane of {O}, vlateral is the angle
formed by vlateral and its nearby vertices in Vo,footprint,t. Given
the target corner for alignment vcorner
and its corresponding
angle vcorner
, the deviation x is transformed into s as
translation deviation:v
vlateral T{OH}vcorner
inclined deviation:
corner lateral
where corner, lateral is the angle value of vcorner
and vlateral
respectively. x 0 is considered equal to s 0.
Since the footprint fully contains the projection of the inter-
section part beneath the board surface plane, the environmental
constraints as dened in Eq. 4 are projected into the XY -plane
of {O} as Ao,footprint,t T{OH}Ah.
In the following, we describe the process of inclined corner
alignment as v reaches zero and the process from inclined to
insertion as  reaches zero. Since each degree of freedom in
the Cartesian space of {O} is decoupled as Kd is a diagonal
stiffness matrix, we aim to leverage the potential caused
by translation deviation for corner alignment and rotational
deviation for insertion based on Lemma 4.8.
Lemma 4.8. Under the quasi-static assumption, the motion
of the peg x is considered driven by a potential energy eld:
2(xd x)Kd(xd x)
Given an interaction cv
t), the resulted steady
pose xt1 automatically falls into its nearby local minimum
energy under the non-penetration environmental constraints as
U(xt) U(xt1) U(xd
potential energy eld. Also, the peg cannot move to a higher
energy state without external force.
Inclined Corner Alignment: By constraining the deviation
between the starting state xt and desired state xd
t only as planar
translation in the XY -plane of {O} (as illustrated in Fig. 5-
(b)), the applied external force to the peg dened by Eq. (5)
can be projected into the XY -plane as follows:
The formulation of Fplanar
can be rewritten into a potential
energy eld based on the desired point vd R3 and any point
v R3 on the XY -plane of {O} in a quadratic form:
UXOY(v)  1
2(vd v)Kd1:3,1:3(vd v)
As illustrated in Fig. 5-(c12), for an angle formed by the target
corner vertex vj  T{OH}vcorner
and its nearby vertices, its
edges are considered non-penetration walls in UXOY(v). Let
vt be the position of vlateral at time t; we aim to leverage such
constraints to shape the motion of vt to rest at vj under the
drive of UXOY(v). Specically, our objective is to formulate a
potential well to let vj be the local minimum in a potential
energy eld so that vt tends to rest at vj without escaping. This
process involves two fundamental requirements: 1) nding an
area Awell to place the attraction point vd (dened by (xd
and 2) nding the basin of attraction Abasin where all initial
states vt inside it will eventually move to vj. Both Awell and
Abasin should only condition on the non-penetration constraints
from angle vivjvk.
We start with a straightforward example of aligning a point
vt to a determinate vertex vj in the small interior area of an
angle vivjvk on the XY -plane of {O}. First, the formulation
of Awell is dened in Lemma 4.9. Then, we introduce the
formulation of Abasin in Lemma 4.10.
Lemma 4.9. Area Awell R3 exist on the XY -plane of {O}
and only condition on the angle vivjvk (as visualized in
Fig. 5-(c1): Region A), for any desired point vd Awell, vj
is always the local minimum state in the created basin of
attraction Avd
basin R3 (as visualized in Fig. 5-(c2): Region
B). Awell is dened as:
Awell  {v R3
2 vivjv (3
2 vivjvk)}
while Avd
basin is dened as:
basin  {v R3  vivdv vivdvk vivjv vivjvk}
represents the energy level of a quadratic-formed energy eld.
As vd Awell, vt Avd
thus proven vj is the local minimum state in Avd
basin establish.
Lemma 4.10. Area Abasin R3 exist on the XY -plane of
{O} and only condition on the angle vivjvk (as visualized
in Fig. 5-(c3): Region B). For any desired point vd Awell
dened in Eq. (24), vj is always the local minimum state in
Abasin. Abasin  {Avd
basin  vd Awell} is dened as
Abasin {v R3  vvivj
when  vd vj vd Awell
as Fenergy  UXOY(v). While  vd vj
vt Abasin moves along with the force gradient and will
get in contact with the non-penetration wall rst. As long as
vt is in contact with the wall, the component of the energy
gradient Fenergy that is normal to the wall is canceled out
by the non-penetration constraint as illustrated in Fig. 5-(b2).
Given the walls normal vector nwall at the contact point, the
modied force gradient is derived as Ftotal  Fenergy Fwall
UXOY(v)  (UXOY(v)  nwall)nwall. For any vt in contact
with the wall, it performs physical gradient descent under force
Ftotal and reaches the local minimum as the force gradient
Ftotal  0 when nwall is on the same line of Fenergy. As proven
in Lemma 4.9, the local minimum of energy eld is at vj, thus
proven Abasin establish.
Based on Awell and Abasin, the corner alignment process is
introduced in Lemma 4.11 through potential well construction.
Lemma 4.11. Under the condition that energy caused by
translation deviation is signicantly larger than that caused
by rotation deviation, by setting the desired state xd
t with its
projected vd Awell, any starting state xt with vt Abasin
will automatically align with the target corner (as the lateral
edge of pv intersects with vj at state xt1  (xt, xd
the target corner creates a potential well with vj as its local
minimum energy state, as proved in Lemma 4.9 and 4.10, xt1
automatically rests at the local minimum state as vt1 vj.
