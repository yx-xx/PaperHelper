AbstractFrom dating to job interviews, making new friends
or simply chatting with the cashier at checkout, engaging in
small talk is a vital, everyday social skill. For adults with
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), small talk can be particularly
autonomous robot system that allows users to practice small
talk. Results from the week-long study show that adults with
ASD enjoyed the training, made notable progress in initiating
conversations and improving eye contact, and viewed the system
as a valuable tool for enhancing their conversational skills.

I. INTRODUCTION
Imagine a scene where three coworkers are engaging in
small talk at the beginning of their workday. One of them
is Alex, who has Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a neu-
rodevelopmental condition that often makes it challenging to
understand and interpret social cues .
Hey everyone, hows it going?
Hi! Not bad... just trying to power through this Monday.
How about you, Alex?
Monday is okay.
Good to hear. Anything exciting happen this weekend?
I watched a movie.
Glad you liked the restaurant, Ben. Its my kids favorite
spot these days... What movie did you watch, Alex?
The Martian.
I love that one! Matt Damon is awesome.
No response.
At first glance, this brief example of a typical interaction ap-
pears unremarkable. It represents the everyday small talk that
occurs regularly in many workplaces. For workers with ASD,

responses provide minimal information rather than actively
participating in the flow of the conversation. Additionally,
Alexs lack of response to the last prompt may suggest
difficulty in extending or sustaining the dialogue.
Although workers with ASD are often highly trained and
skilled in job-specific tasks, they frequently face challenges
with social interactions in the workplace. Mller et al.

roles. This underemployment is further highlighted in the

skills are proven to be more significant predictors of overall
success [25, 29, 48]. Hurlbutt  Chalmers  found that
workers with ASD often attributed job-related challenges to
social factors rather than the work-specific tasks themselves.

is even regarded as a vital skill that should be targeted in
communication therapy for various populations [25, 29, 20].
To better support adults with ASD, it is important to develop
accessible and targeted opportunities for improving interper-
sonal skills, such as small talk. Social robotics has the potential
to enhance existing training initiatives by improving access to
actions [39, 66, 10, 58]. Physically present robots have proven
effective in improving users social abilities [67, 58], provid-
ing benefits such as enhanced engagement, improved social

. Social robots have demonstrated general effectiveness in
enhancing verbal communication skills [33, 62, 31], includ-
ing the ability to engage in everyday dialogue [3, 27, 45].
described such robot-assisted training as relevant and useful
in their workplace experiences [41, 58].
for ASD interventions [66, 67, 58], we developed an au-
tonomous training system that helps adults with ASD improve
their small talk skills. Given the literature on the communica-
tive difficulties of ASD (Sec. II), we begin by examining the
extent to which small talk is considered a desired social skill
(Sec. III). These insights inform our design requirements (Sec.
V) and guide the development of our prototype (Sec. IV). In
that formative study, we investigate initial impressions, percep-
tions of robot-assisted training, and anticipated outcomes for
users with ASD. We then present findings from a week-long,
in-home deployment (Sec. VII), highlighting how users with
ASD received and engaged with the robot-assisted training.
II. RELATED WORK
Atypical communicative behaviors are key diagnostic cri-
teria for ASD , often presenting as limited eye contact,
difficulty understanding sarcasm or abstract language , and
challenges in grasping the social rules that govern everyday
interactions . However, everyday, casual conversations are
a pervasive aspect of daily life, whether it is chatting with
a neighbor about the weather, maintaining friendships, or
making a positive impression on the first day of a new job.
Unlike more structured interactions, which can be formal-
ized to teach more easily as a script [7, 1], small talk demand
quick thinking, social flexibility, and the ability to interpret
subtle cues such as tone, timing, and context. Training to
improve such skills in adulthood presents unique challenges
compared to childhood, as many social habits and patterns
are already established by the time individuals reach adult-
hood . These patterns may manifest in the development
of strategies to avoid social situations entirely ; hence,
the skill development that typically occurs through ongoing
social interaction may not have been fully realized or prac-
ticed. Furthermore, while children have more opportunities for
structured social learning and development through school or
develop these skills [53, 22, 24].
As a result, interventions for adult learners often require
more personalized approaches, targeting specific barriers to
communication and focusing on building confidence in real-
world conversational contexts. Therefore, in this section, we
overview the structure and value of small talk, outline formal
intervention strategies that may inform the pedagogical design
of small talk training, and highlight the potential for robot-
assisted social skills training for ASD. This summary of the
literature ultimately reveals a gap: while there is a recognized
need for small talk skills, there is limited input from adults
with ASD themselves regarding the challenges they face in
adulthood and few opportunities for targeted training. To
address this gap, we conducted a survey to gather insights
from adults with ASD (Sec. III).
A. Structure and Value of Small Talk
While the boundaries of conversation types are fluid, small
talk has a recognized currency in sociolinguistics and com-
munication studies . It refers to informal, light-hearted
exchanges focused on building social connections rather than
conveying substantial detail, often covering general, non-
controversial topics like the weather and hobbies.
Small talk does not have a strict formula, as it is inherently
flexible and context-dependent. However, a typical small talk
dialogue follows the general sequence of conversation, begin-
ning with a greeting and ending with a closing remark, while
emphasizing specific characteristics at each stage [28, 12, 59]:
1) Greetings and openers: Initiating the conversation with
a greeting or commenting on a shared experience such
as the weather or the immediate environment.
2) General topics: Discussing non-controversial and gen-
eral topics such as hobbies, interests, or recent events.
3) Reciprocity: Both participants take turns sharing and
evant participation in the conversation.
4) Closure: The conversation ends with a closing remark,
such as indicating appreciation or a future interaction.
For any individual, the characteristics of small talk highlight
the subtlety and skill needed to navigate this form of conversa-
tion effectively. For adults with ASD, there is a notable overlap
between the challenges inherent in small talk and the broader
difficulties they report facing in everyday social interactions.
We discuss this overlap further in Sec. III.
B. Current Approaches to Small Talk Training
Addressing the unique challenges of small talk for individ-
uals with ASD requires targeted interventions. Although there
are currently no programs focused solely on small talk, many
broader training initiatives include elements that indirectly
support small talk competency. Moreover, while the limited
availability of such training for adults with ASD has not been
widely explored or critiqued in the literature, the following
sections review broader communication programs, which are
primarily focused on children with ASD. We then examine
how these established methods could potentially address the
specific challenges of small talk for adults with ASD.
1) Didactic Approaches: Didactic approaches, or classical
Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), break skills into smaller
components and train each through highly structured, drill-
like practice [50, 17, 15]. While didactic methods have proven
effective in various intervention studies for ASD [78, 13], they
heavily depend on teacher guidance, prompted responses, and
contrived reinforcement methods . An inherent limitation
of didactic methods lies in their tendency to encourage passive
may struggle to initiate communication or apply learned
behaviors beyond the specific training context.
2) Naturalistic Approaches: Contemporary or naturalistic
