AbstractThe behavior of in-home robots must be adaptable
to end-users to adequately address individual users needs and
preferences. Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a common
approach for customizing robot behavior, enabling non-expert
users to teach robots how to perform tasks according to their
preferences. While LfD allows users to teach robots tasks, it can
be difcult for users to specify their individual needs a priori.
Interventions (LIFI), a user-friendly and streamlined method
for personalizing robot behavior through interventions. This
approach allows users to easily prompt the robot to adapt its
behavior by intervening when the robots behavior goes against
user expectations. With LIFI, 1) the user intervenes to communi-
cate that the robot is making a mistake, 2) the robot then learns
an explanatory feature that describes the failure and 3) uses it to
adjust its policy to correct the mistake, aligning with user-specic
needs. In a between-subjects evaluation experiment with 48

I. INTRODUCTION
Due to an aging population, there is a shortage of caregivers
[24, 40]. Robots have the potential to offer assistance and
enable older adults to age in place . Assistive robots must
be adaptable in order to meet users diverse environments
and changing needs as they age. Furthermore, useful assistive
robots will need to adapt to new situations and recover from
any failures or miss-steps that will inevitably happen when
operating in the real world . However, many current
personalization approaches are costly or not scalable [22, 38].
Training a generalized policy that can adapt to different
scenarios a priori requires a large data set for the policy
to function well in a variety settings . On the other

correct a robots behavior. Therefore, we introduce Learning
Interpretable Features from Interventions (LIFI) (Figure 1), a
novel framework that enables a robot to learn interpretable
features from user interventions and utilizes these features to
correct its mistakes.

The demonstrations start from the warning to show the robot
how to avoid the failure. (3) With a new user, the robot infers
their reason for interruption and improves its behavior.
Our LIFI approach builds from Learning from Demonstra-
tion (LfD) . In LfD, the robot learns from a recording of
the human demonstrating the task. The simplest form of LfD,
Behavioral Cloning (BC), mimics the human; however, BC
is susceptible to covariate shift . Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) techniques attempt to understand context by
learning a reward function for the humans goal ; yet, IRL
methods are not sample-efcient [3, 16]. Furthermore, most
LfD techniques are not interpretable due to their reliance on
black-box neural networks .
We want to enable people to teach a robot their preferences
with a method that is sample-efcient and provides semanti-
cally meaningful feedback. Therefore, we learn interpretable
features in the LIFI framework to teach the robot to correct its
mistakes. We dene interpretable here as the robot outputting
semantically meaningful features in human-worded language.
With LIFI, participants intervene once during robot task exe-
cution when the robots behavior does not match the humans
preference. Ideally, a user would communicate which features
are important to them, and the robot would learn to prioritize
the appropriate parts of the task, resulting in higher perfor-
mance and trust in the robot . However, it can be difcult
for people to identify and communicate their preferences and
key task features a priori . A more effective approach may
be for people to critique while observing a robots attempt to
perform a desired task. Prior work has investigated learning
features from physical interventions [5, 7], but these methods
do not use interpretable features and users were told a priori
which features to pay attention to.
In our approach, we show that when people intervene during
a robot failure, there is semantic information, environmental
and temporal context clues, from which the robot can learn.
For example, if someone stops the robot when the robot is
putting bleach on a shelf the user deems wrong, the robot
could observe its distance relative to objects in the environment
and learn that the important feature is to put the bleach with
the other cleaning products instead of next to the food.
In this paper, we rst introduce the LIFI framework. Then,
we experimentally validate LIFI through multiple user studies,
in which the robot attempts a series of household tasks and
participants intervene when the robot fails or does not behave
as desired. Initially, we conduct a pilot study to elicit a list of
features from users. Then we collect a dataset of interventions,
feature labels, and corrective demonstrations to train LIFI.
(i.e. without features, BC, and ablations of the method).
In this paper, we contribute the following:
1) We develop a new, user-friendly, low cognitive demand
interface for feature specication through interventions.
2) We contribute the LIFI framework, an interpretable,
feature-based approach that enables LfD policies to learn
what users want and adapt to individual users needs.
3) We demonstrate that LIFIs feature prediction generalizes
to novel users and LIFI outperforms a no feature baseline
(p < .05) for performance, workload, usability, and trust.
II. RELATED WORKS
LfD seeks to enable humans to teach robots new skills via
human task demonstrations without requiring users to have
programming experience . Behavioral Cloning (BC) learns
to mimic human actions, but inherently does not understand
the humans intent behind the demonstrations . Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods attempt to learn a
reward function for the humans intent, but these methods are
not sample efcient . LIFI lls both gaps by adding a feature
vector to a BC policy that attempts to understand human intent,
while being sample-efcient. Unlike IRL methods, LIFI does
not need hours of training time at evaluation.
LIFI also addresses the need to know which features a user
cares about when specifying a demonstration. Without this
a priori feature knowledge, a feature mismatch may cause
the robot to fail to learn the skill, which can result in trust
degradation [20, 34, 17]. Researchers have considered various
approaches for learning from robot failures with LfD. Our
work is inspired by Kelly et al.  and Spencer et al.
who proposed having people take over task execution when
the robot deviates from the desired behavior. However, prior
work that learns from human interventions [21, 39, 5] do
not learn interpretable features or provide explanations for
the updated policy. LIFI improves upon state-of-the-art by
learning interpretable and semantically meaningful features.
Prior work has also explored learning what feature prompted
an instance of user feedback . Bajcsy et al. show that
learning one feature per intervention compared to all at once
improves objective and subjective results . In contrast,
Levine et al. investigated learning which features to consider
by constructing features from components using logical con-
jugations . While this work shows how both features and
a policy can be learned at the same time, it does not consider
whether the features selected by this method are deemed
important by the demonstrator. This could lead to a correct
policy that does not adhere to the demonstrators preferences.
We endeavor for our features to be based on human

III. TECHNICAL APPROACH
In this section, we introduce the LIFI framework.
A. Preliminaries
LfD can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process
without the reward function (MDPR) which is represented
by the 4-tuple S, A, T , . S is the set of states and A is
the set of actions. In a model-based paradigm, the transition
function T : S A S[0, 1] represents the probability
of transitioning from state s to state, s, via action, a.  is

the agent learns a policy,  : S A, mapping states
to actions, from a demonstrator provided set of trajectories
{(st, at), t {1, 2, ...T}}. Our approach is model-free,
meaning that we do not know the transition function a priori.
B. LIFI Framework
The LIFI model architecture (Figure 2, Algorithm 1) con-
sists of two parts. First, the Feature Prediction Network, g,
takes in the robot state trajectory, r, the states of the objects
in the world, w, and the time of interruption, i, and outputs a
feature vector, f. The time of interruption i is used to crop r
so that only the robot trajectory up to the time of interruption is
given as input. Thus, g uses the world state up to the time of
interruption to predict the feature. Second, the Policy Network,
f and outputs the next robot action, a. In the LIFI framework,
the set of features, comprising f, (detailed in Section IV-C) is
split into two types: 1) relational features (e.g., too high, too
to itself or objects in the environment and 2) the environment
objects (e.g. table, dishwasher, etc.). For example, if the person
interrupts because the robot is cutting the table instead of the
To determine the features, we interview users in the Pilot Study
(Section IV-C). We synthesize their responses to ascertain a list
of features that are generalizable across manipulation tasks.
1) Feature Prediction Network: To learn the feature vector
or reason for interruption, f, the g network feeds r, w, and i
through a multi-head self-attention layer. The reasoning for the
attention layer is for the features to index on important aspects
of the trajectories. The trajectories are the Cartesian pose of
the robot end-effector and objects (position and quaternion).
The attention layer output is a classication embedding, which
is concatenated with a one-hot encoding of the domain and
fed through a linear layer. This output is an encoding, ,
and is fed through a tanh activation and a linear layer, to
predict the relational features. The relational features are then
concatenated with  and fed through a linear layer to predict
the object features.
We train this model using the labeled features from the data
collection study (Section V-A) and cross-entropy loss
The list of features are known a priori and are determined to
be common across manipulation tasks, from the Pilot Study
(Section IV-C). Using softmax, the robot can then predict the
most likely feature from the feature vector, f, and utilize
templated language, from the labels, to communicate the
feature to the user.

feature. However, we assume that people will interrupt in
different states based on their preferences. In practice, this
is a reasonable assumption as the state space is continuous so
two identical interruptions are highly unlikely.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We conduct three human-subjects experiments; an overview
is depicted in Figure 3. We rst conduct a pilot study to
elicit a list of relevant features from users. We then conduct
a data collection study where users interrupt the robot, label

We investigate how communicating the predicted feature of

B. Experiment Setup
We employ the Spot robot , a ZED camera , and
1) Domains: Prior work has shown that chore tasks are
relevant for assistive robots [37, 36]. We design four household
tasks as the domains (Figure 3):
1) Loading the Dishwasher - the goal is to place the
plastic dish in the tabletop dishwasher.
2) Putting Bleach Away - the goal is to place the bleach
bottle on the pantry shelf.
3) Sweeping Up Glass - with a hand-held broom, the goal
is to sweep the broken glass into a dustpan.
4) Cutting Food - the robot must use a knife to cut the
Play-Doh cookie roll.
where to place a dish in the dishwasher, not putting cleaning
items next to food).
2) Wizard-of-Oz Trajectories: To show the participants a
consistent set of robot behaviors, we pre-specify ve trajecto-
ries in each of the four domains (20 total). To compare across
a variety of behaviors, each domain includes: one success, two
objective failures, and two subjective failures. For the failures,
we focus on system errors, in which the robot does not act as
but should not have acted in that way . An objective failure
occurs when the robot fails to complete the task goal (e.g.,
colliding with the dishwasher). A subjective failure is when the
robot achieves the goal without satisfying a users preferences
(e.g., placing the dish in the wrong orientation). To investigate
trajectories are used as the initial robot policy for all studies.
3) Domain and Trial Ordering: In all three studies (pilot,
data collection, and evaluation), participants watch the robot
complete the Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) trajectories and interrupt if
the robot is making a mistake or not behaving as desired. The
frequency and timing of robot errors impact user behavior and
perception of the robot . As such, the order of successes
and failures are randomized and then held constant across par-
ticipants. In the data collection phase, participants experience
one success, two objective failures, and two subjective failures
per domain. Appendix Table II lists the ordering of trial
outcomes for each domain that each participant experiences
in the data collection phase. During the evaluation phase,
participants observe three trials per domain (one success,
one objective failure, and one subjective failure). Appendix
Table III lists the ordering for the evaluation phase. Which of
the two subjective and objective failures is randomized and
counterbalanced across participants.
Participants also experience multiple domains in all three
studies. Appendix Table I lists four domain orders, obtained
via a Latin square. Each participant experiences one domain
ordering condition. The domain orders are randomly assigned
and counterbalanced across participants.
C. Pilot Study
The pilot study has two goals: 1) to elicit a list of features
from participants and 2) to assess our study design. Since the
robot behavior is WoZ, we need to determine whether par-
ticipants perceive each trajectory as intended (i.e., successful
trajectories are perceived as successes, objective failures as
failures). Past experiments have shown that participants do
not intervene, even if the robot is colliding with objects .
As such, we evaluate and improve the instructions to ensure
participants intervene when observing objective robot failures.
1) Pilot Study Procedure: Participants observe each trajec-
tory in each domain (as specied in Section IV-B3). After
each trial, participants are asked to rate the success of the
trajectory on a scale of 1 (unsuccessful) to 10 (successful).
Participants also answer why they did or did not interrupt the
robot. We transcribe the interviews and conduct a thematic
content analysis with two reviewers  to determine a core set
of important features across domains. This yields a dataset of
features of importance from the population rather than using
an experimenter-dened dataset. Based on our ndings, we
design a Graphic User Interface (GUI) for users to choose
which feature reects their reason for interruption.
2) Pilot Study Results: The pilot study consisted of 13
participants with a mean age of 23.8 and standard deviation
(SD) of 3.58 (30.8 Female, 69.2 Male). On average,
participants rated successes with a score of 7.8 out of 10,
subjective failures with 5.8, and objective failures with 4.0. On
the dishwasher task, participants rated successes lower than
high. On the bleach task, the objective failures were rated
higher than expected: 5.6, due to not all participants rating
collisions negatively. Therefore, for the data collection study,
we redesigned the dishwasher task and told participants that
the robot should complete the tasks without colliding.
the robot failed irrecoverably (e.g., wiped all the glass on the
oor). We included a warn button that does not stop the robot
so participants can indicate when the robot might be about
to make a mistake. We later use this pre-failure moment to
let people provide corrective demonstrations that show how
to avoid the failure. We found that warning the robot allowed
participants to signal to the robot, while still satisfying their
curiosity about what the robot would do next.
After each trial, we asked participants why they interrupted
the robot. The most common reasons were the orientation
of the object that the robot was holding, the position of the
object compared to other objects, and the speed of the robot.
Participants also mentioned the force applied by the robot,
specically in the cutting task. However, we chose not to
include force due to not being able to measure force from
video demonstrations. The list of features is included in Figure
3. Representative quotes from participants are in Appendix D.
D. Data Collection Study
The goal of the data collection study is to collect a dataset
from participants to train the LIFI framework.
1) Data Collection Procedure:
We conduct a within-
subjects (n  44) data collection study where participants
observe the robot complete trials in each of the domains, akin
to the pilot study. In the data collection phase, the participant
observes the robot execute a WoZ policy for ve trials per
two subjective failures. The domains are randomized and
counterbalanced via Latin Squares (see Section IV-B3).
To interrupt the robot, the participants are instructed to press
a yellow warn button before the robot makes a mistake, and
the red stop button after the robot has made a mistake or the
participant thinks the robot will not recover. After interrupting,
participants indicate on our GUI which feature is their reason
for interruption. Participants can choose more than one feature
but must indicate which feature is most important. Next, we
show participants a picture of when they rst pressed the
warn button. Using this image, participants then provide a
demonstration via motion-capture, starting from the position
where they rst pressed the warn button, to show the robot
how it should have performed the task differently. We use this
data to train the LIFI model (Section III-B).
2) Manipulation Check: The data collection study included
44 participants with a mean age of 23.2 (SD4.01, 29.5

types of trials. We employed Friedmans tests with Nemenyi-
Wilcoxon-Wilcox post-hoc tests. Out of 10, participants rated

failures with a mean of 5.81 (SD1.21), and objective failures

Fig. 4: We solicited reasons for interruption in the Pilot Study (n  13). We found that the main reasons people interrupted the

with a mean of 3.28 (SD.969). There was a signicant main
effect between the trial types (2(2)  84.0, p < .001).
Successful trials were rated signicantly higher than subjective
failures (p < .001) and objective failures (p < .001), and sub-
jective failures were rated signicantly higher than objective
failures (p < .001). Similarly, there was a signicant main ef-
fect for interruption rate between the trial types (2(s)  80.0,
p < .001). Participants interrupted successful trials at a rate
of 18.8 (SD18.1), subjective failures at a rate of 51.1
(SD23.2), and objective failures at a rate of 97.7 (SD5.6).
Participants interrupted successful trials signicantly less than
subjective (p < .001) and objective failures (p < .001). Lastly,
participants interrupted subjective failures signicantly less
than objective failures (p < .001). Overall, the types of trials
were designed and perceived as expected.
E. Evaluation Study
1) Conditions: In our third experiment, after our pilot study
(Section IV-C) and data collection study (Section V-A), we
manipulate the independent variable, Feature Condition, with
the following conditions:
LIFI  Learned Feature (Ours): The robot infers the
highest probability feature and then attempts the task using
the learned feature (Section III-B). Then the robot communi-
cates the feature (using templated language, e.g. I think you
interrupted because of X.) as an explanation to the user.
MI-LIFI  Mixed-Initiative (Ours): The robot infers the
best feature and then communicates the feature to the user. If
the user feels that the robot should have chosen a different
The robot then utilizes the learned, or corrected feature, as an
input to the policy network, and attempts the task again.
BC  No Feature: The robot learns how to accomplish
the task via BC, does not predict a feature, and does not
communicate with the user.
Adv-LIFI  Adversarial Feature: This condition is the
same as LIFI, except the robot infers the worst feature (mini-
mum probability). Adv-LIFI accounts for bias when working
with interactive systems.
2) Evaluation
between-subjects experiment (n  12 per condition), where
each participant experiences one Feature Condition (Section
IV-E1). Participants experience three trials for each of the four
domains. The domains are randomized and counterbalanced
via Latin Squares (see Section IV-B3). In the evaluation phase,
the number of trials was reduced because the BC policy
performed similarly across trials, due to BC not personalizing
to individual participants interruptions. It may have become
obvious to participants that the robot was not learning from
their interruptions if the robot performed similarly across too
many trials. Therefore, the participant observes three trials per
failure. The objective and subjective failure trajectory chosen,
from the two in the data collection, are randomized and
counterbalanced across participants.
Participants rst ll out pre-study surveys. Then participants
observe the robot attempt a series of household tasks, and
participants are instructed to interrupt using the same proce-
dure as the data collection study. If participants interrupt a
feature of importance, dependent on the Feature Condition.
After each trial, participants complete the post-trial surveys.
F. Metrics
We now describe the metrics employed to evaluate our
framework. More details on metrics are in Appendix C.
1) Framework Training Metrics:
We rst validate the
model ofine with a holdout set from the data collection data.
Feature Accuracy: We compare the model predicted fea-
tures to the participant labeled features using an all-or-nothing
and a partial-credit metric. For both metrics, if the participants
top feature matched the models predicted feature, we scored
that as a 1. For the all-or-nothing metric, if the models feature
differed at all from the top feature given by the participant,
we gave it a score of 0. For the partial-credit metric, if the
predicted feature was a feature given by the participant but
was not the top feature, we gave it a score of 0.75. If the
model guessed a feature or object that the participant input,
we gave a score of 0.5.
Policy Error: We dene Policy Error as the difference
between the policy generated trajectories and the successful
WoZ trajectories to measure error. Additionally, to quantify
personalization from the features, we compare the generated
trajectories to the participant demonstrations. We calculate
error by aligning trajectories using dynamic time warping
and measuring the absolute pose error (APE) . To gain
further insight into the policy error, we also separate out the
error into orientation and position error.
2) Pre-Study Metrics: At the beginning of the evaluation
(a) Demographics: We collect participant age and gender.
(b) Personality: We employ the Mini-IPIP .
(c) Negative Attitudes Towards Robots (NARS): We
measure the three NARS subscales .
3) Post-Trial Metrics: After each trial, we measure the
accuracy of the features and robot policy. All scales from 1 to
10 are from 1 (not successful) to 10 (successful).
(a) Feature Ratings: Participants rate the robots predicted
feature on a scale from 1 to 10.
(b) Feature Accuracy: We compare participant-provided
feature(s) to the model-predicted feature as described
in the Framework Training Metrics.
(c) Perceived Policy Accuracy: Users rate the robots
performance on a scale from 1 to 10.
(d) Policy Error: We compare the robots trajectory to
a successful trajectory using the same method as the
framework training metric.
(e) Qualitative Interview: We interview participants to
understand why they did or did not interrupt.
4) Post-Study Metrics: After the evaluation study, we col-
lect the following metrics:
(a) Interruption Rate: We measure how often participants
intervened across trials.
(b) Usability: We employ the System Usability Scale .
(c) Workload: We measure workload via the NASA Task
Load Index .
(d) Trust: We employ the trust scale by Jian et al. .
(e) Qualitative Interview: We interview participants about
the process of working with the robot.
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the results, for each statistical test, we compared condi-
tions using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). To check for
confounding factors on subjective metrics, we systematically
added the demographic variables as covariates to each model
(i.e., age, gender, personality, and attitudes towards robots),
only keeping the covariate if adding it lowered the models

A. Data Collection Study: Model Validation
We rst conduct an ofine validation of the model on the
data collection dataset. We split the dataset into an 8020
training and test set with 5-fold cross-validation. After training
the LIFI framework on the training set, we evaluated the model
on the test set using feature accuracy and policy error metrics.
1) Feature Accuracy: We compared the predicted features
to the labeled features in the test dataset. The model predicted
the user-specied most important feature with 67 accuracy.
While this accuracy may seem low, there is ambiguity in
the feature labels and participants often chose more than one
label. One participant might say the knife was too close
to the table, while another would say the knife was too
low compared to the table, and a third may choose both
options. After inspecting where the model guessed wrong,
many incorrect guesses were due to ambiguity (e.g., choosing
object orientation instead of object alignment). Therefore, we
determine the utility of our feature predictions in the evaluation

ture prediction (Section V-B). Takeaway: Combining results
from the data collection and evaluation studies, LIFI learns
an informative relationship between user interruptions and
the semantic concept of that failure (RQ1).
2) Policy Error: We generated trajectories for the LIFI,
tests with Nemenyi-Wilcoxon-Wilcox post-hocs. In Figure
the generated trajectories and WoZ successful policies across
conditions (2(2)  69.3, p < .001). LIFI had signicantly
lower error than BC (p < .001), as did Adv-LIFI (p < .001).
We also calculate the error between the generated tra-
jectories and the participants demonstrations. There was a
signicant main effect for the policy error across the con-
ditions (2(2)  89.1, p < .001). As shown in Figure 5b,
LIFI had signicantly lower error than BC (p < .001) and
Adv-LIFI (p < .001), showing that adding correct features
better personalized to users. Also, Adv-LIFI had signicantly
lower error than BC (p < .001), meaning that providing
the incorrect feature still personalized better than no features.
performance over a baseline without features (RQ2).
B. Evaluation Study
The evaluation study included 48 participants with a mean
age of 24.2 and an SD of 3.24 (33.3 Female, 64.6 Male,
and 2.1 Other). We conducted ANOVAs with Tukey post-
hocs (or Kruksal-Wallis tests with Dunns post-hoc, for non-
parametric tests). We report effect sizes from Tukey post-hoc
as TD and effect sizes from Dunns post hoc as r.
1) Manipulation Check: We checked interruption rates to
ensure that the WoZ trajectories were not perceived differently
across conditions. There was no signicant difference in
interruption rate between conditions (2(3)  1.18, p  .758).
We next analyzed how participants perceived the features
inferred by LIFI and MI-LIFI compared to Adv-LIFI. We
found a signicant main effect for perceived success between
feature conditions (F(2, 33)  23.0, p < .001). Participants
perceived features inferred by LIFI (p < .001, TD  2.27)
and MI-LIFI (p < .001, TD  2.83) as signicantly more
correct than features from Adv-LIFI.
When comparing between LIFIs guess and the features
labeled by participants, LIFI and MI-LIFI combined had an av-
erage all-or-nothing score of 0.43 (SD.50) and a partial-credit
score of 0.64 (SD.36). Comparatively, Adv-LIFI had an all-
or-nothing score of 0.17 (SD.38) and a partial-credit score of
0.23 (SD.39). We found a statistically signicant difference
in score between LIFI, MI-LIFI, and Adv-LIFI for the all-or-
nothing metric (2  15.11, p < .001) and the partial-credit
metric (2  41.24, p < .001). For the all-or-nothing metric,
LIFI outperformed Adv-LIFI (p  .04, r  0.21) and MI-LIFI
outperformed Adv-LIFI (p < .001, r  33). In the partial
credit metric, LIFI outperformed Adv-LIFI (p < .001, r
0.45) as did MI-LIFI (p < 0.001, r  0.51). Takeaway:
LIFI and MI-LIFI were better at picking a feature that
matched participant expectations than Adv-LIFI. The LIFI
framework can adequately predict correct and incorrect
features intentionally, providing further evidence for RQ1.
2) Objective Metrics (Policy Error): We compare the tra-
jectories generated by the policy for each condition to the WoZ
successful trajectory (Figure 6a). We found a signicant main
effect for planned policy error between conditions (F(3, 44)
70.1, p < .001). The planned policy error for BC is signif-
icantly higher than Adv-LIFI (p < .001, TD  0.47), LIFI
LIFI (p < .001, TD  0.27) and MI-LIFI (p < .001, TD
0.24). The trajectories for LIFI and MI-LIFI are signicantly
closer to success compared to BC and Adv-LIFI, and Adv-
LIFI is signicantly closer to success than BC.
The planned trajectory was sent to the robot, however, the
robot may have been unable to complete the trajectory due
to infeasible kinematics or the experimenter interrupting the
trajectory early due to a collision. Therefore, we also calculate
error between the robots executed trajectory and the WoZ
successful trajectory across conditions. We found a main effect
across feature conditions (F(3, 44)  19.1, p < .001). BC has
signicantly higher executed policy error compared to Adv-
and MI-LIFI (p  .001, TD  0.30). Figure 6b shows that
