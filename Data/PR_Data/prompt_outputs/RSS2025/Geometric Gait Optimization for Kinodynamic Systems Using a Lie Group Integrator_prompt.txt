内容：Geometric Gait Optimization for Kinodynamic
Systems Using a Lie Group Integrator
Yanhao Yang, Ross L. Hatton
AbstractThis paper presents a gait optimization and motion
planning framework for a class of locomoting systems with mixed
kinematic and dynamic properties. Using Lagrangian reduction
and differential geometry, we derive a general dynamic model
that incorporates second-order dynamics and nonholonomic
robots with nonholonomic constraints as well as swimming robots
with nonisotropic fluid-added inertia and hydrodynamic drag.
Building on Lie group integrators and group symmetries, we
develop a variational gait optimization method for kinodynamic
systems. By integrating multiple gaits and their transitions, we
construct comprehensive motion plans that enable a wide range
of motions for these systems. We evaluate our framework on three
representative examples: roller racer, snakeboard, and swim-
mer. Simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate diverse
of the proposed method and its potential for generalization to
other biological and robotic locomoting systems.
I. INTRODUCTION
Animals use a diverse set of gaitssuch as horses trot-
ting and galloping, snakes slithering and sidewinding, and
body-caudal fin swimming in fishto locomote effectively in
various environments. By switching or transitioning between
different gaits, animals demonstrate remarkable efficiency and
In both biology and robotics, significant research has been
conducted on various forms of locomotion. Beyond systems
whose dynamics are either fully determined by nonholonomic
constraints or solely governed by conservation of momentum
, there exist classes of locomoting systems that exhibit
both kinematic and dynamic effects. These systems, referred
to in this paper as kinodynamic systems, have garnered consid-
erable attention due to their time-varying nonlinear dynamics
and high degree of underactuation.
A representative example of kinodynamic systems is aquatic
animals swimming at intermediate Reynolds numbers. The
swimming of these aquatic animals is modeled as a system
with drift (the ability to glide) due to the mixed inertial
and fluid drag effects [39, 31]. This system is distinct from
swimming at very high or low Reynolds numbers, where the
dynamics are respectively dominated by conservation of mo-
mentum [27, 23] or quasistatic drag equilibrium [39, 64, 51],
both of which produce driftless (or kinematic) locomotion

Execution of the comprehensive motion plan computed using the
proposed method on the roller racer robot. The green curve depicts the
robots position trajectory, and the composite figure illustrates the robots
configuration at different times. The roller racer has only one actuated degree
of freedom: the steering angle between the front and rear wheels, with all
wheels being passive and driven by anti-slip constraints and steering angle
changes. The motion plan incorporates multiple gaits and transitions, enabling
the robot to: a) start from rest and nominal shape into the gait cycle, b)
accelerate to the optimal steady-state motion, c) smoothly switch to the steady-
state gait that maintains maximum speed, d) execute a turn with minimal
energy loss and return to steady-state motion, and e) end the gait cycle
and return to the nominal shape. Throughout the execution, the motion plan
maintains the desired heading angle and meets the average power consumption
constraints.
behavior. There is existing work that applies perturbation
analysis to kinodynamic swimming locomotion to approximate
the average motion over a gait cycle, enabling the design
of sinusoidal gaits and image-based feedback control .
Subsequent study models robotic fish by incorporating fluid-
added mass, lift, and drag forces, deriving oscillatory control
strategies through controllability analysis . Other works
extend Lighthills large-amplitude elongated body theory by
introducing resistive forces [7, 8], resulting in a kinodynamic
swimming model, which was later used in  for modeling
swimming robots and performing gait search. Additionally,
simplified swimming robot systems, such as Chaplygins
sleigh and its variants, have been studied for their control and
motion planning [30, 20, 32].
combination of nonholonomic constraints and nonholonomic
momentum evolution. The snakeboard [48, 46] and roller
racer [36, 22] are two representative examples. These systems
have inspired extensive research on kinodynamic locomotion,
including controllability analysis and gait design using sinu-
soidal waves [42, 47, 36], gait selection via optimal control
inversion problem [12, 11]. Other studies have explored gait
design using area rules , analytical solutions for trajectory
tracking [54, 18], and the integration of kinodynamic systems
with bipedal riders . Additionally, efforts have been made
to enhance the fidelity of kinodynamic models based on
the snakeboard and roller racer. For instance, some studies
incorporate dissipative forces or viscous friction [29, 46, 36],
account for skidding effects , or introduce improved fric-
tion modeling [49, 53]. Variants of these systems have also
been studied, with research focusing on their modeling and
control [15, 56].
Given that the positions of kinodynamic systems relative
to the world are described by elements of Lie groups, nu-
merical methods that exploit this group structure and pre-
serve its symmetries offer significant advantages in terms of
accuracy and efficiency [38, 21, 13]. These methods have
demonstrated superior performance across various domains,
including simulation [25, 10], control [34, 62], and estimation
[3, 4]. Moreover, variational integrators and discretization
techniques that preserve group structures can be combined
with optimal control to enhance both accuracy and stability
[37, 6, 35, 24, 52]. This idea has been applied to a variety
of robotic systems, including ground vehicles , quadrotors
, and legged robots [58, 17]. These advancements highlight
the potential of Lie group integrators as a powerful tool for
gait optimization in kinodynamic systems.
A common baseline for gait optimization is to use standard
optimal control techniquessuch as direct collocation  or
indirect methods without exploiting Lie group theory.
in which quadrature-based integral approximations may violate
dynamic constraints and accumulate errors, allowing the opti-
mizer to cheat in highly nonlinear systems. While indirect
methods offer better forward rollout accuracy, their backward
pass is more complex and they struggle to incorporate addi-
tional state or input constraints. In contrast, gait optimization
methods that leverage Lie group theory enable full-fidelity
simulations and allow for the direct imposition of constraints
on both control inputs and trajectories, with gradients obtained
via the chain rule.
One line of related work uses Lie group theory for geometric
gait optimization via constraint curvature and the generalized
Stokes theorem [51, 23], but these methods mainly apply
to principally kinematic systems. Geometric insights into the
dynamic phase in kinodynamic systems have been developed
to better understand their structure, though the approach relies
on trial-and-error selection of gaits that couple the geometric
and dynamic phases . Furthermore, other studies employ-
ing Lie group theory or integrators for motion planning in
kinodynamic systems have predominantly focused on way-
point tracking or trajectory optimization [37, 6, 35, 24, 52].
These methods can suffer from discretization errors over long
trajectories and require recalculation for each new waypoint or
trajectory. In contrast, this work focuses on gait optimization
to avoid long trajectory discretization and to generate reusable
motion primitives that enable comprehensive motion planning.
The main contribution of this paper is a gait optimization
and motion planning framework for kinodynamic systems.
This framework comprises:
A general kinodynamic model incorporating kinematic
and dynamics effects, based on Lagrangian reduction
and differential geometry, applicable to a broad range
of kinodynamic systems, including wheeled robots with
nonholonomic constraints and swimming robots with
anisotropic fluid-added inertia and hydrodynamic drag.
A variational gait optimization method for kinodynamic
metries.
A methodology for constructing comprehensive motion
plans that integrate multiple gaits and their transitions,
enabling diverse motion capabilities for kinodynamic
systems.
We evaluate our approach on three representative systems: the
roller racer, the snakeboard, and a swimmer at an intermediate
Reynolds number. All systems are evaluated in simulation, and
the roller racer is additionally tested in hardware experiments.
These evaluations demonstrate the ability of our framework
to achieve a wide range of motions, including acceleration,
steady-state maintenance, gait transitions, and turning, as
shown in Fig. 1 that illustrates the experiment conducted on
the roller racer robot. The results underscore the effectiveness
of the proposed approach and its potential for generalization
to other biological and robotic locomotion systems.
II. KINODYNAMIC SYSTEM MODELING
Kinodynamic systems are characterized by the interplay of
kinematic and dynamic effects. Kinematic effects include the
relationship between inertia, velocity, and momentum, as well
as nonholonomic constraints. Based on the kinematics, one
can derive the reconstruction equation that relates the systems
body velocity to its shape velocity and nonholonomic mo-
mentum. Dynamic effects are governed by the Euler-Lagrange
constrained forces. Through the application of Lagrangian
