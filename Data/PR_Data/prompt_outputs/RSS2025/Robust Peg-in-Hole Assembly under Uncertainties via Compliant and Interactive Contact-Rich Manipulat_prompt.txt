exceed the allowed clearance. In this paper, we study how to lever-
age contact between the peg and its matching hole to eliminate
uncertainties in the assembly process under unstructured settings.
By examining the role of compliance under contact constraints,
we present a manipulation system that plans collision-inclusive
interactions for the peg to 1) iteratively identify its task envi-

without relying on precise perception, enabling a robust solution

present a formal approach to constructing manipulation funnels

I. INTRODUCTION
Robotic peg-in-hole assembly is a foundational skill in
various industrial applications and beyond, involving inserting
a peg into its matching hole on another object under tight clear-
ances . Common strategies seek to optimize the insertion
trajectory under certain conditions, either through explicitly
modeling the task environment or formulating the problem
as a POMDP  (partially observable Markov decision
process) to enable reactive policies based on sensory input.
Regardless of the debate on how accurately a model describes
manipulation lies in the execution . It is the execution
that brings the optimized result from planning into the real
world through motor actuation by the controller. However,
real-world perception challenges and physical uncertainties,
such as those arising from hardware limitations, can introduce
small deviations between planned and executed trajectories.
Under the tight tolerance of peg-in-hole assembly, even minor
uncertainties can lead to undesired manipulation outcomes.
effort to tackle real-world uncertainties beyond solely planned
trajectories.
Acknowledging that planned trajectories are rarely executed
perfectly in the real world due to uncertainties, focusing on
the outcomes of interactions between the system and the
environment [15, 14], rather than on explicit trajectories, offers
a promising approach to achieving robust manipulation. This
formulation often requires the role of compliance, either from
mechanical design [12, 42] or computational simulation ,
to passively adapt to external contacts. Rather than causing
undesired outcomes, environmental constraints can shape the
compliant manipulation process toward the desired outcome
under deliberate exploitation , even without elaborate con-
tact models [44, 8]. With this insight, we propose leveraging
the contacts between the peg and its matching hole as an
advantage to eliminate uncertainties for ne insertions.
In this paper, we introduce a manipulation system (shown
in Fig. 1) that plans compliant interactions between the
manipulated peg and its task environment to identify and
exploit contact constraints for robust insertion. Safe contact
is ensured by impedance control , which allows external
contact to alter the pose of the peg by mimicking a spring-
damper behavior. Since the steady pose of the peg after
each interaction is observable and is a combined effect of
the environmental constraints and potential from impedance
to shrink the target holes proposal distribution progressively
and 2) exploit the environmental constraints to shape the
motion of the peg to enter its matching hole. Specically,
the exploitation process involves maintaining constant contact
between the peg and the hole to serve as motion constraints.
Since the environmental constraints can shape a large margin
of uncertainties and the interaction mechanism of force-pose
regulation is independent of the specic trajectory taken, the
proposed system can tolerate uncertainties smaller than its
execution precision, even under tight tolerances.
As the system dynamics progressively eliminates uncer-
tainty in perception and execution, we formulate the proposed
system as a composition of manipulation funnels in different
state spaces. The original concept of the manipulation funnel
was introduced by Mason  to eliminate uncertainties in ob-
ject location, emphasizing that the robustness of funnel-based
manipulation requires the co-design of robot interaction and
task mechanics. A general formulation of the funneling process
can be dened in any task-relevant space as a progressive
space shrinkage for uncertainty elimination. Inspired by the
planar theory of automatic motion synthesis , we establish
a formal approach to constructing manipulation funnels for
robust ne insertion of general prismatic pegs in the real world.
The primary contributions of this paper are:
We present an uncertainty-absorbing paradigm for general
peg-in-hole insertion based on the concept of manipula-
tion funnel, which does not plan on the explicit trajecto-
ries but rather the outcome of each compliant interaction.
We present a formal approach to constructing the funnel-
ing process for both perception and execution, which can
be further composed for general peg-in-hole insertion.
We provide a system with detailed algorithms to imple-
ment the above funnel-based manipulation paradigm on
real-world assembly tasks.
We conduct ablation studies through extensive experi-
ments on a standard assembly benchmark NIST ATB and
additional challenging tasks to validate the robustness and
generalizability of the proposed paradigm and system.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
reviews related works. Section III introduces the preliminaries
and problem statement for funnel-based manipulation planning
in peg-in-hole assembly. Section IV introduces the task me-
chanics and presents a formal approach to constructing manip-
ulation funnels in perception and execution. Section V demon-
strates the robustness of the proposed system in simulation
and real-world experiments. We discuss the limitations under
current settings in Section VI and summarize the contributions
in Section VII.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Peg-in-Hole Assembly
Over the past decade, pipeline-based and end-to-end ap-
proaches have driven advancements in robotic peg-in-hole
systems. Pipeline-based approaches aim to explicitly esti-
mate intermediate system states for motion planning. Previous
works [25, 51, 27] leverage tactile or forcetorque sensors
for contact state estimation. Vision-based methods [54, 21]
estimate alignment deviations for correction or search motion
planning. This modular design provides interpretability and
data-driven methods. In contrast, end-to-end approaches
aim at deriving an implicit function to map sensory inputs to
motor skills from trial-and-error. The entire system connects
feature extraction to planning in a unied manner [13, 37, 50,
ciple that assembly is a relative positioning task , as-
suming the robot will precisely execute the issued trajectory.
Our research targets a different perspective , as the ne
insertion motion is a passive renement process that exploits
environmental constraints.
B. Compliance-enabled Manipulation
Compliance

through passive adaptability. The role of compliance in robot
manipulation often involves compensation for uncertainty
and safe interaction with the environment, which has been
adopted in a wide range of tasks, including dexterous grasp-
ing [6, 33, 12], in-hand manipulation [32, 41, 2], grasp
adaptation [31, 19, 26], assembly [40, 38, 55] and human-
robot co-manipulation [47, 43].
environmental constraints to eliminate uncertainties, ensuring
robust and dexterous manipulation [14, 20, 11, 46, 56, 23, 7].
In this work, we propose a formal approach for compliance-
enabled contact between the peg and the hole to eliminate
uncertainty in insertion motions.
C. Funnel-based Manipulation
Mason  proposed the original concept of manipulation
funnels to eliminate uncertainties based on task mechanics
and task-specic interaction. The importance of exploiting
task mechanics to eliminate uncertainties is also revealed in
concepts such as pre-image  and backprojections .
Early works have applied funnel-based designs in manipula-
tion tasks, including ball batting , part orienting [18, 17] and
et al.  investigated funnel-based action primitives for in-
hand manipulation through an empirical study. Canberk et al.
proposes canonicalized-alignment as task mechanics to
funnel the large space of possible cloth congurations into a
The major challenges in developing funnel-based manipu-
lation lie twofold: 1) formulating the general task mechanics
for a given manipulation task and 2) dening task-specic
interaction beyond hardware-associated control. To tackle the
above challenges in real-world peg-in-hole tasks, we provide
a general formulation of the task mechanics of peg-in-hole
insertion and an object-centric interaction mechanism, which
is not dependent on any specic hardware.
III. PRELIMINARIES AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this work, we consider the peg-in-hole assembly problem
as inserting a peg into its matching hole on a planar board
surface as illustrated in Fig. 2-(a). We aim to plan compliant
motions of a manipulated peg that frequently makes and breaks
contact with its task environment, rst to perceive the location
of the matching hole on the task board and then insert the peg
into it under tight clearance.
A. Preliminaries
1) Geometry of the Peg and Hole: The 3-dimensional (3-
D) geometry of the hole is described in the hole reference
frame {H}, as an intrusion of a 2-D polygonal base dened
by an ordered sequence of vertices Vh  (v0
R3 is the corresponding unordered set of the Vh. The intrusion
is along the negative direction of the Z-axis of {H}. Vh
denes a planar region Ah R3 on the XY -plane of {H}
Ah  {(x, y, z) R3  fAh(x, y) 0 z  0}
where fAh(x, y) is an implicit distance function to describe
the boundary of Ah as fAh(x, y)  0 and its interior area as
fAh(x, y) < 0, exterior area as fAh(x, y) > 0.
The 3-D geometry of the peg is described in the peg
reference frame {E}, as an extrusion of a 2-D polygon
base Ve  (v0
e ), ve R3, zve  0 on the XY -
plane of {E}. Its corresponding unordered set is denoted as
S(Ve)  n
e} R3.The extrusion is along the positive
direction of Z-axis of {E}, and Ve is considered approximated
equal to Vh but dened in different frames.
2) Task Environment: We specify the Cartesian world
frame {O} attached to the task board, as its XY -plane is
aligned with the board surface and its orthogonal Z-axis points
outward the task board. The pose of the hole in the world
frame is denoted as T{OH} SE(3). We describe the task

which is dened as follows:

in which 1 denotes occupied by the task board, 0 denotes
on the surface of the task board, and 1 denotes the free space.
An initial area of interest Aboard R3 is specied on the
XY -plane of {O} that guarantees T{OH}Ah Aboard.
3) Compliant Interactions for the Peg: As the peg is in a
prism-shaped geometry as dened in Sec. III-A1, we use the
densely sampled points Pe  {pi
i1 on the edges of
the peg for collision checking (considered continuous along
the lateral and base edges), in which pe  (x, y, z) is in the
Cartesian coordinates of {E}. The sampled points are assumed
to be rigidly attached to each other, as the entire point set
undergoes the same rigid body transformation (rotation and
translation). The pose of frame {E} with reference to frame
{O} at time t is represented as xt  [p; r] R6, in which
p R3 is the position vector and r R3 is the orientation
represented with Euler angle. The target peg-in-hole state is
denoted as x. The corresponding transformation matrix of
xt is denoted as T{OE},t SE(3). An overview of the task
environment with the manipulated peg is illustrated in Fig. 2-
To enable safe contact between the peg and its task envi-
desired state xd
t R6 at time t. A wrench F R6 (consisting
of 3-D force and torque) is applied to the peg by a Cartesian
impedance controller as formulated:
F  Kd(xd
t xt) Dd xt
in which Kd R66 is the diagonal stiffness matrix to
decouple compliance in each degree of freedom, Dd R66
is the damping matrix for movement stabilizing and xt R6
is the velocity of {E} with reference to {O} at time t.
An interaction command ct  (xt, xd
t) at time t is dened
by its starting state xt (considered steady as xt  0) and a
desired state xd
t. A compliant interaction xt1  (xt, xd
between the peg and its task environment is an unknown but
observable process  : R6  R6 7R6 from the starting state
xt to the next steady state xt1, under the drive of xd
t and the
environmental constraints in the frame of {O}. Except for the
virtually dened desired state xd
xt1 during this process is constrained by its task environment
as follows:
po T{OE},t1Pe, (xpo, ypo, zpo)  1
We do not explicitly predict or trace the trajectory of the peg
during this process but only observe its steady state at xt and
xt1. At the steady state xt1, any external contact wrench
Fext R6 in frame {O} is balanced by the pose deviation as:
Fext  Kd(xd
while the velocity xt1  0 of the peg remains zero.
We use the intersection point set Po,footprint,t R3 between
the pegs edges and the XY -plane of {O} at the steady pose
xt to describe the outcome of each interaction as:
task board.
B. Problem Statement
We formulate the peg-in-hole assembly task as a progressive
uncertainty elimination process in the state space of perception
and execution. We aim to plan interactions ct  (xt, xd
between the peg and its task environment to 1) iteratively re-
duce the uncertainty of the perception result of the target hole
and 2) nish the peg insertion under execution and perception
uncertainty. An overview of the peg-in-hole assembly process
is outlined in Alg. 1.
Perception State Space: We use eT{OH} to denote the esti-
mated state of the ground truth T{OH}. The estimation result
at time t is represented with a probabilistic density function
Pt( eT{OH}) bounded by a proposal region Xt SE(3), which
is dened as follows:
Pt( eT{OH})
eT{OH} Xt
eT{OH} Xt
where Xt denotes the volume of region Xt.
We aim to form a recursive sequence of proposal regions
based on the outcomes Po,footprint,t of each interaction ct:
X0 X1 X2    XT 1
As Xt shrinks over steps, the expected spread of eT{OH}
decreases and the uncertainty range of the perceived holes
state is reduced.
Execution Task Space: Let x R be the deviation
between the steady state xt and the peg-in-hole state x. Based
on the estimated state distribution of PT 1( eTOH), we aim to
shrink x at each step of interaction ct to progressively reach
the peg-in-hole conguration as follows:
We consider a successful peg-in-hole assembly when x
reaches zero.

IV. FUNNEL-BASED MANIPULATION PLANNING
A manipulation funnel represents a convergence process by
iterative contractions from a larger entrance to a smaller exit
state space, ensured by task-specic interactions. A general
funnel formulation is dened as Denition 4.1.
Denition 4.1. Let S be a task-relevant space that could
represent any system parameters. Given a target state s, we
aim to nd subspaces Sin S so that after applying some
state transition functions, denoted as  : S S, the resultant
output space Sout S is guaranteed to be strictly smaller than
the input space: Sin > Sout. If these conditions are satised
, sSin and sSout, a tuple F  (Sin, , Sout) is called
a manipulation funnel.
We rst dene the task-specic interactions based on the
task mechanics in Section IV-A. Then, we introduce the formal
approach to construct manipulation funnels in perception state
space (Section IV-B) and execution task space (Section IV-C).
A. Task Mechanics and Interaction Primitives
Funnel-based manipulation planning requires deep exploita-
tion of the intrinsic task mechanics . As perception and
physical uncertainties are inevitable , our key insight is
forming an aligned corner between the inclined peg and the
target hole to create contact constraints for undesired motion
freedoms and progressively enter the allowed clearance (as
illustrated in Fig. 3-(a)). A corner from the hole is dened
by arbitrary vertex vcorner
S(Vh) as the local angle vcorner
formed by vcorner
and its nearby edges from the interior side.
In this paper, we use the case of vcorner
<  for motion
funnel construction. However, theoretically, it also applies to
the case of vcorner
>  as long as the local convexity exists.

this local geometry enables the downstream iterative insertion

Despite the trajectory being a dominant action representa-
tion in manipulation planning, it is unsuitable for funnel-based
manipulations as interactions with the task environment are
allowed to alter the motion of the manipulator . Given the
target corner vcorner
of the hole, its corresponding vertex on the
base of the peg is denoted as pv  vcorner

cos() cos()
cos() sin()
Interaction with inclined states is designed to identify and
exploit its environmental contact constraints. Such a formu-
lation offers several advantages: 1) when the peg engages
with the task board from above (as illustrated in Fig. 4),
the observation Po,footprint,t is divided into binary categories
based on the cardinality of the set Po,footprint,t: whether it is
a contact point or an intersection area between the peg and
hole; 2) an inclined state relaxes the requirement for a peg to
be partially entered into the hole ; 3) before an insertion
task is nished (considered vertical w.r.t. the board surface
plane), all peg states can be described as inclined states during
the insertion process.
B. Perception Manipulation Funnel
The perception manipulation funnel aims to iteratively re-
duce the proposal region Xt of the target holes distribution
Pt( eT{OH}) through observation from each interaction. By
strategically placing the supporting vertex pv of the desired
state xd
t beneath the XY -plane of {O}, we can intentionally
capture the encountered contact constraints reected on the
resulted steady state xt1. As illustrated in Fig. 4, after each
an inequality constraint as dened in Denition 4.3 to limit
the distribution of eT{OH}.
Denition 4.3. An inequality constraint on the possible space
of eT{OH} is dened as gt( eT{OH}) 0 based on the observa-
tion Po,footprint,t, where gt( eT{OH}) is dened as:
po Po,footprint,t,
gt( eT{OH})
T{OH}Ah(po), Po,footprint,t  1
T{OH}Ah(po), Otherwise
in which  is the cardinality of the set. For a potential holes
state eT{OH}, any contact point (as Po,footprint,t  1) should
be excluded from the holes area, while any intersection area
(as Po,footprint,t > 1) should be fully contained by the holes
The proposal region at t  0 is derived from the initial area
of interest Aboard as follows:
X0  { eT{OH}  eT{OH}Ah Aboard}
The proposal region at step t is dened as:
Xt  { eT{OH} X0 SE(3)  gi( eT{OH}) 0, i  1, 2, ..., t}
which is updated at step t  1 with the new added constraint
gt1( eT{OH}) 0 as:
Xt1  Xt { eT{OH} SE(3)  gt1( eT{OH}) 0}

feasible region Xt is monotonically decreasing (Xt1 Xt)

As Xt shrinks over steps in Lemma 4.4, the expected spread
of eT{OH} decreases, and the allowable state space of the target
hole narrows.

included in the allowable state space as T{OH} Xt over

Since the proposal region Xt1 Xt of the target hole
is monotonically shrinking over interactions cv
the target state T{OH} is guaranteed to be contained by Xt
and Xt1, we introduce the perception manipulation funnel as
dened in Theorem 4.6.

lation funnel in the perception state space.
region Xt is shrinking and approaching T{OH} over random

funnel is established based on the general Denition 4.1
duced to improve convergence efciency. An overview is
outlined in Alg. 2. The probability distribution Pt( eT{OH}) of
the target holes state is dened by Eq. 7 and the initial area
for exploration Aboard is divided into grid points G  {gi
i  1, 2, ..., N} where gi R3 on the XY -plane of {O}.
During each interaction, number K of potential holes states
is sampled as { eT{OH},i}K
i1 Pt( eT{OH}). The probability
Pin that g is included by the target hole is dened by:
i1 h( eT{OH},i, g)
h( eT{OH}, g)
g eT{OH}Ah
Otherwise
Let H() represent the entropy of the given probabilistic
density function. The expected entropy reduction is formulated
H(g)  H(Pt( eT{OH})) E[H(Pt( eT{OH})  g)]
where E[H(Pt( eT{OH})  g)] is the expected entropy after
evaluating g. To maximize information gain, the desired state
should spatially overlap with the selected grid point gG
that maximizes H(g) for contact constraints identication:
g arg max
The convergence of the proposed entropy-based exploration is
proven in Theorem 4.6.

C. Physical Manipulation Funnel
The physical manipulation funnel aims to leverage envi-
ronmental contacts as physical constraints in the execution
task space to iteratively reduce x for peg-in-hole insertion.
Based on the task mechanics as Fig. 3-(a), we consider a
sequential process as 1) aligning an inclined state to its
corresponding corner and 2) adjusting the aligned inclined
state to insertion. All the states xt described in this section
are considered inclined states, which are dened by pv, ,
and  as introduced in Eq. (10) and (11). We describe
the spatial relationship between the xt and x(the target
peg-in-hole state) based on the Po,footprint,t and the target
corner vcorner
. Specically, Po,footprint,t forms a 2-D polygon
as Vo,footprint,t
corresponding area Ao,footprint,t R3 on the XY -plane of
{O}. The state deviation x is dened based on Vo,footprint,t
and vcorner
as Denition 4.7.
Denition 4.7. Given an inclined peg state xt with the lateral
edge of the supporting vertex pv intersects with the XY -plane
of {O}, we project its state as  : R6 7R4. We use the

Fig. 5: (a) The pegs state xt is projected as [vlateral; lateral]. (b) By setting the translation deviation between the desired state xd
and the starting state xt only on the XY -plane of {O}, a 2-D potential energy eld is formulated. (c) The corner alignment
process is formulated as aligning the point vt  vlateral to the corner vj  vcorner
under the drive of the created potential energy
vlateral R3 and the angle value lateral R of vlateral to
describe the pose as (xt)  [vlateral; lateral], as illustrated in
Fig. 5-(a). vlateral is the intersection point between the lateral
edge of pv and the XY -plane of {O}, vlateral is the angle
formed by vlateral and its nearby vertices in Vo,footprint,t. Given
the target corner for alignment vcorner
and its corresponding
angle vcorner
, the deviation x is transformed into s as
translation deviation:v
vlateral T{OH}vcorner
inclined deviation:
corner lateral
where corner, lateral is the angle value of vcorner
and vlateral
respectively. x 0 is considered equal to s 0.
Since the footprint fully contains the projection of the inter-
section part beneath the board surface plane, the environmental
constraints as dened in Eq. 4 are projected into the XY -plane
of {O} as Ao,footprint,t T{OH}Ah.
In the following, we describe the process of inclined corner
alignment as v reaches zero and the process from inclined to
insertion as  reaches zero. Since each degree of freedom in
the Cartesian space of {O} is decoupled as Kd is a diagonal
stiffness matrix, we aim to leverage the potential caused
by translation deviation for corner alignment and rotational
deviation for insertion based on Lemma 4.8.
Lemma 4.8. Under the quasi-static assumption, the motion
of the peg x is considered driven by a potential energy eld:
2(xd x)Kd(xd x)
Given an interaction cv
t), the resulted steady
pose xt1 automatically falls into its nearby local minimum
energy under the non-penetration environmental constraints as
U(xt) U(xt1) U(xd
potential energy eld. Also, the peg cannot move to a higher
energy state without external force.
Inclined Corner Alignment: By constraining the deviation
between the starting state xt and desired state xd
t only as planar
translation in the XY -plane of {O} (as illustrated in Fig. 5-
(b)), the applied external force to the peg dened by Eq. (5)
can be projected into the XY -plane as follows:
The formulation of Fplanar
can be rewritten into a potential
energy eld based on the desired point vd R3 and any point
v R3 on the XY -plane of {O} in a quadratic form:
UXOY(v)  1
2(vd v)Kd1:3,1:3(vd v)
As illustrated in Fig. 5-(c12), for an angle formed by the target
corner vertex vj  T{OH}vcorner
and its nearby vertices, its
edges are considered non-penetration walls in UXOY(v). Let
vt be the position of vlateral at time t; we aim to leverage such
constraints to shape the motion of vt to rest at vj under the
drive of UXOY(v). Specically, our objective is to formulate a
potential well to let vj be the local minimum in a potential
energy eld so that vt tends to rest at vj without escaping. This
process involves two fundamental requirements: 1) nding an
area Awell to place the attraction point vd (dened by (xd
and 2) nding the basin of attraction Abasin where all initial
states vt inside it will eventually move to vj. Both Awell and
Abasin should only condition on the non-penetration constraints
from angle vivjvk.
We start with a straightforward example of aligning a point
vt to a determinate vertex vj in the small interior area of an
angle vivjvk on the XY -plane of {O}. First, the formulation
of Awell is dened in Lemma 4.9. Then, we introduce the
formulation of Abasin in Lemma 4.10.
Lemma 4.9. Area Awell R3 exist on the XY -plane of {O}
and only condition on the angle vivjvk (as visualized in
Fig. 5-(c1): Region A), for any desired point vd Awell, vj
is always the local minimum state in the created basin of
attraction Avd
basin R3 (as visualized in Fig. 5-(c2): Region
B). Awell is dened as:
Awell  {v R3
2 vivjv (3
2 vivjvk)}
while Avd
basin is dened as:
basin  {v R3  vivdv vivdvk vivjv vivjvk}
represents the energy level of a quadratic-formed energy eld.
As vd Awell, vt Avd
thus proven vj is the local minimum state in Avd
basin establish.
Lemma 4.10. Area Abasin R3 exist on the XY -plane of
{O} and only condition on the angle vivjvk (as visualized
in Fig. 5-(c3): Region B). For any desired point vd Awell
dened in Eq. (24), vj is always the local minimum state in
Abasin. Abasin  {Avd
basin  vd Awell} is dened as
Abasin {v R3  vvivj
when  vd vj vd Awell
as Fenergy  UXOY(v). While  vd vj
vt Abasin moves along with the force gradient and will
get in contact with the non-penetration wall rst. As long as
vt is in contact with the wall, the component of the energy
gradient Fenergy that is normal to the wall is canceled out
by the non-penetration constraint as illustrated in Fig. 5-(b2).
Given the walls normal vector nwall at the contact point, the
modied force gradient is derived as Ftotal  Fenergy Fwall
UXOY(v)  (UXOY(v)  nwall)nwall. For any vt in contact
with the wall, it performs physical gradient descent under force
Ftotal and reaches the local minimum as the force gradient
Ftotal  0 when nwall is on the same line of Fenergy. As proven
in Lemma 4.9, the local minimum of energy eld is at vj, thus
proven Abasin establish.
Based on Awell and Abasin, the corner alignment process is
introduced in Lemma 4.11 through potential well construction.
Lemma 4.11. Under the condition that energy caused by
translation deviation is signicantly larger than that caused
by rotation deviation, by setting the desired state xd
t with its
projected vd Awell, any starting state xt with vt Abasin
will automatically align with the target corner (as the lateral
edge of pv intersects with vj at state xt1  (xt, xd

Insertion under Motion Constraints: As constant contact
between the peg and its matching hole is established, we aim
to leverage the motion constraints from the environment to
synthesize insertion motions. Successful insertion motions are
formulated as a sequence of interactions S  [cv
that connect the initial inclined state to the target peg-in-
hole conguration. We keep the alignment tight by keeping
the projection vd of the desired state inside vd
The alignment is formed by the energy eld caused by the
translation deviation; additionally, we aim to leverage the
energy eld caused by the rotation deviation to drive the
insertion process.
Denition 4.12. Let
formulated as follows: under the condition that the corner
contact is formed as a pivot point, a complete insertion is
regarded as progressively turning the inclined angle of the
peg approaching vertical as  .
We describe the relative motion between the peg and its
matching hole using a contact reference frame and a manipu-
lation frame. As illustrated in Fig. 6, a contact reference frame
{C} is attached to the on the corner T{OH}vcorner
its origin is at T{OH}vcorner
and its Z-axis shares the same
direction with {O}. The positive direction of its X-axis is
aligned with the rotation angle  from the inclined state of the
peg on the XY -plane of {O}. The Y -axis is placed orthogonal
with reference to the XZ-plane of {C}. By denition, {C}
is not xed with reference to {O} as its X-axis is dened by
the rotation angle  of the pegs inclined state.

possible pose of the peg is restricted by its projection lateral <
corner and the uncertainty range is subject to . Since the
orientation of the inclined peg is subject to , proving that
{C} is a constrained frame with reference to {O}.
Selecting a manipulation frame {M} attached to the peg is
critical to describe its relative motion in {C}. Since the inter-
actions cv
t are constrained as Denition 4.2 by a supporting
vertex pv, we set the origin of {M} to pv with its Z-axiss
positive direction towards n. The X-axis of {M} is placed
orthogonally in the plane formed by the lateral edge of pv
and the X-axis of {C} as illustrated in the Planar View 2 of
Fig. 6. We denote the instantaneous relative motion of {M}
with reference to {C} at time t as a twist vector t  [
in which   [x, y, z] R3 is the rotation rate along each
axis of {C} and d  [dx, dy, dz] R3 is the rate of change
of the position.
Lemma 4.14. During the insertion process (Denition 4.12),
t is restricted to translation in the XZ-plane of {C} and
rotation about the Y -axis of {C}, forming a subset of SE(3).
{M} lies in the same geometric plane in {O}, thus proving
that the relative motion is restricted as   [0, y, 0, dx, 0, dz]
Since frame {C} is within a limited range, it can be
regarded as a static frame at any instant movement t described
in Lemma 4.15.
Lemma 4.15. Under the condition that the energy caused by
rotation deviation is signicantly larger than that caused by
translation deviation, by setting the desired states orientation
as a small rotation yt on the current state, the deviation
is decreasing, and the uncertainty range  of
{M} is shrinking.
the translation motion v is a result rened by the passive
force from the environmental contacts. The peg cannot break
the alignment according to Lemma 4.8, as the result {M} is
always lower than {C} in the world frame. Such formulation
also guarantees that an enlarged inclined angle represents
a smaller potential energy state in the caused energy eld;
the transition between the pegs state automatically leads
to a higher inclined angle under its environmental motion
constraints according to Lemma 4.8. As illustrated in the
Planar View 1 of Fig. 6, the rotation motion x and z is
constrained by the limited range of , as the  increases,
decreases.
By incrementally increasing the inclined angle  and up-
dating the measurement of the inclined states rotation angle
, the pegs state will progressively move towards the target
state while its uncertainty range  is shrinking towards
zero. Theoretically, the robustness of the insertion process is
conditioned on the pegs state xt instead of its geometric size.

in Lemma 4.11 and  decreases to zero as proven in
Lemma 4.15 over environmentally constrained interactions cv
thus proving the physical manipulation funnel established.

sets a desired state xd

the inclined angle t at state xt and the target inclined angle

V. EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we evaluate the proposed framework across
a diverse range of peg-in-hole tasks to demonstrate its robust-
ness and generalizability. Ablation studies are conducted to
gain deeper insights into how the funnel-based manipulation
approach mitigates uncertainties arising from perception and
execution. Specically, these experiments aim to validate:
(1) the perception manipulation funnel eliminates uncertain-
ties in the proposal distribution of the target holes state
while tolerating uncertainties from the imprecise interactions;
(2) the physical manipulation funnel absorbs perception and
execution uncertainties to achieve precise insertion; (3) by
leveraging funnel-based manipulation planning, the system
achieves robust and precise insertion tasks with a tolerance
level surpassing the robots inherent execution precision.
A. Experiment Setup
Our experimental setup is shown in Fig. 7-(a). We test the
proposed funnel-based manipulation framework on a robotic
system consisting of a Franka Emika Panda manipulator with
GelSight Mini attached to the ngertips of its parallel jaw
gripper. No camera is required as our system eliminates
uncertainties purely through physical interactions. This design
removes any system dependence on variable lighting condi-
tions and textures, making it easily generalizable to different
scenarios. It is worth noting that, though visual modality is not
estimation of the target hole, which can be further rened
by interactive perception or directly bridged with insertion.
The in-hand pose of the grasped peg is observed from its
corresponding tactile imprints, as discussed in the Appendix.
Our system design does not require slipping-free conditions
since the proposed funnel theory is object-centric. Two types
of controllers are adopted in our real-world experiments:
1) a Cartesian impedance controller with a translation error
up to 2mm and 2) a Cartesian position controller with a
translation error up to 1mm due to imprecise internal models.
A detailed formulation of Cartesian impedance control for
a manipulator is discussed in the Appendix. The Cartesian
position controller is applied in position-based commands, and
the Cartesian impedance controller is applied in commands
requiring physical interactions. Under external contacts, the
object undergoes only minor elastic movements on the tactile
sensors planar surface, while major pose deviations are reg-
ulated by the robots Cartesian impedance controller through
the end-effector.
The system is tested on a NIST ATB benchmark and
additional tight-clearance tasks, with detailed parameters of
the peg-in-hole tasks shown in Fig. 8. The experimental
pegs are selected with different base symmetries (ranging
from central symmetry and axial symmetry to asymmetry),
evaluation. It is also worth noting that, although chamfer1 on
the peg and the hole would make the insertion process easier,
as it relatively enlarges the entry space, it is excluded in our
experiments for a more challenging task formulation.
B. Perception Manipulation Funnel
We conducted detailed experiments in PyBullet  to
evaluate the robustness of the perception manipulation funnel
for uncertainty elimination in the perception state space (as
1In the context of peg-in-hole tasks, the chamfer refers to the beveled or
tapered edge at the entrance of the hole (and sometimes at the tip of the peg).
A chamfer added to the edges can help reduce contact forces, reduce jamming
and tolerate misalignment.

illustrated in Fig. 7-(b)). Specically, we aim to demonstrate
that 1) the perception manipulation funnel is robust against a
large range of action uncertainties and 2) the entropy-based ex-
ploration signicantly accelerates the uncertainty elimination
process.
To quantify the uncertainty level of actions, given a de-
sired interaction point gd  (xd, yd, 0) on the board sur-
face plane (XY -plane of {O}), the actual interacted point
ga  (xa, xa, 0) incorporates additional positional noise as
action uncertainty from a 2-D Gaussian distribution as follows:
f(xa, ya)

Jaccard index to calculate the distance between the ground

posal distribution as the convergence level:

Random exploration serves as a baseline policy to demonstrate
that 1) the intrinsic convergence mechanics of the perception
manipulation does not rely on any specic action strategy
and 2) the proposed entropy-based exploration benets the
convergence efciency.
The results, presented in Fig. 9, show the systems perfor-
mance after eight steps of interaction under different levels of
action noises and a random policy. Pegs with smaller scales
are more sensitive to the systems uncertainty, as the relative
error is signicantly larger than the pegs with larger scales.
Despite high action noise relative to the pegs scale, all the
test objects successfully converge to a high convergence level.
Even random actions would signicantly shrink the proposal
distribution of the target hole due to the mechanics of the
formulated perception funnel.
C. Physical Manipulation Funnel
We evaluate the robustness of the physical manipulation
funnel through peg insertion into the target hole as shown

in Fig. 7-(c), which is considered a known position. We
compare the robustness of funnel-based manipulation with
position-based manipulation as a baseline, which formulates
the insertion process by positioning the peg into the hole
without collisions. The collision-free trajectory is dened
as a top-down insertion with a vertical peg state after a
stable grasp. Since execution uncertainties are inevitable in
real-world scenarios, we aim to demonstrate that 1) when
system uncertainty exceeds the allowed clearance, funnel-
based manipulation for peg insertion is more robust against
position-based manipulation in real-world settings, and 2)
precise manipulation tasks can be achieved through imprecise
funnel-based manipulation.
The experimental result is shown in Table I. Despite the
tight clearance being smaller than the robot execution preci-
uncertainties and inserts the peg at a near-perfect success rate.
In contrast, position-based manipulation expects a precisely
executed trajectory while lacking the ability to tolerate such
uncertainty. Without the help of chamfers on the peg and the
impact caused by the wedging phenomenon . Especially
for asymmetric pegs with a tighter tolerance in both translation
and orientation, we observe that position-based control is
ineffective at small scales.
D. Real-world System Performance
nipulation funnel in a unied system to perform robust inser-
tion without visual feedback in an open loop, as illustrated in
Fig. 7-(d). To comprehensively evaluate the proposed system,
we consider two levels of prior on the target holes state: 1) the
initial pose of the peg is placed partially inside the target hole
by kinesthetic teaching and 2) a larger search area (bounding
circle with 30 dilation) is specied, containing the target
hole on the board surface. The robot needs to identify the
possible state of the target hole on the board surface to nish
the insertion. The results (as presented in Table II) depict the
steps of interactions, uncertainty level (1 J({f
A})) and the
successful rate for each tested peg. Since the proposed system
effectively absorbs uncertainties from an imprecise target hole
state and interactions, we observe very few failure cases from
the overall performance.
We acknowledge the gap between the established object-
centric theory and real-world implementation; the failure mode
can be divided into the following categories: 1) high contact
force which breaks the condition of in-hand stable grasp, i.e.,
the gripper is opened and the peg beyond the observation
range of the tactile sensor; 2) high friction force caused by
interactions between the peg and the hole that causes the
peg largely slipped and is out of the tactile perception range
and 3) the inaccurate dynamics model of the manipulator
for impedance control that leads to unsatised compliance
performance during physical contacts. We believe that using
a more forceful end-effector or a more advanced compliance
mechanism would effectively resolve this issue.
VI. LIMITATIONS
Our work has certain limitations, which naturally reveal the
potential future research directions. First, the current system
relies on a stable in-hand grasp of the peg to perform the
insertion process. A re-grasping policy  can be incorpo-
rated to initialize a new insertion trial for drastic slippage
that exceeds the tactile perception range. Second, current
exploration relies on a priori of the planar exploratory area.
By combining visual modalities and learning-based estimation
and insertion without any prior. Third, as our method doesnt
model friction explicitly, a variable impedance controller is
considered a requirement when encountering interaction with
high resistance.
We envision a future iteration of the proposed robotic sys-
tem that leverages multi-modal perception to partially perceive
the task environment and further plan funnel-based manipula-
tion strategies to robustly shape the interaction process toward

VII. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
In this paper, we have presented a funnel-based manipu-
lation paradigm for robust peg-in-hole insertion, along with
a real-world robotic implementation. The advantages of the
proposed system have been demonstrated through careful
experimentation in simulation and in the real world. A com-
prehensive evaluation of the proposed system is provided on
a standard NIST ATB benchmark and additional challenging
tasks with a satisfactory overall success rate. Most critically,
we highlighted the power of compliance and demonstrated
how a robot can leverage imprecise compliant interactions
to perform precise tasks, similar to how humans achieve
dexterous manipulation. For future work, we aim to expand
the current theory to non-planar scenarios and develop au-
tomated learning methods capable of abstracting funnel-based
manipulation mechanics from natural language descriptions or
video demonstrations and their interaction mechanisms.

APPENDIX
A. Cartesian Impedance Controller
The state of Franka Emika Panda in the conguration space
at time t is denoted as qt R7, with its velocity as qt R7
and acceleration as qt R7. Given the desired state xd
current state xt of the manipulated frame, the robot motion is
regulated by the Cartesian impedance controller based on the
simulated force F as:
M(qt) qt  C(qt, qt) qt  g(qt)  J(qt)F
where M(qt) R77 is the inertial matrix, C(qt, qt) is the
Coriolis and centrifugal matrix, g(qt) is the gravity vector and
J(qt)R76 is the transpose of the Jacobian matrix.
B. Tactile Pose Estimation
Fig. 10: (1) A stable grasp of the peg for insertion; (2) The
corresponding tactile image with the objects imprint; (3) The
estimated in-hand pose of the peg.
We estimate the pegs in-hand pose based on its tail ends
tactile imprint (as shown in Fig. 10). After a stable grasping,
the motion of the object is limited in the SE(2) space as
[x, y, ] on the planar gel surface. We identify the keypoints
from the corner of the peg in the tactile image with a gradient-
based feature extraction method . As the connecting seg-
ment between the extracted corners represents the base of the
orientation is perpendicular to the formed segment. To alleviate
the perception noise for a stable estimation, we apply an
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to smooth the estimated result
and only take it into consideration when it reaches stability. As
long as the peg after slippage does not exceed the observation
range of the ngertip tactile sensors, the estimated in-hand
pose is further leveraged for object-centric manipulation plan-
ning. For our experiments, the perception range of the Gelsight
Mini tactile sensor is around 25mm  20mm, and the end of
the peg is required to show up completely.
C. System Transition Function for MPC
We model the system transition function with a linear prior,
as if there is no external contact, the steady state will reach
the desired state during each interaction. The discrete linear
state-space model of the system is formulated as:
xt1  Atxt  Btut where ut  xd
where A R66 is the state transition matrix and B R66
is the input matrix. Both A and B are initialized as an Identity
between the potential from the impedance control and its
environmental constraints. We aim to approximate the intricate
transition function online, as A and B from Eq. (32) are
updated by an RLS adaptive lter. The system dynamics is
rewritten as:
xt1 tt  t, where t R6
t is the regression vector, t is the system to update and
t is the prediction error. Given a covariance matrix Pt and
a forgetting factor , the gain Kt is calculated based on the
prediction error after each interaction as:
t  xt1 tt
t (  tPt
and the system parameters are updated as:
t1  t  Ktt
t1  [At1
The covariance matrix is then updated as:
(Pt KttPt)
approximated
transition
function
et(xt, xd
d) is dened as:
et(xt, xd
d)  Atxt  Bt(xd
and updated online to identify the underlying dynamics.
D. Computational Complexity Analysis
We perform an additional analysis of the computational
efciency of the proposed system. For Alg. 2, we adopted
a rejection-based sampling algorithm with the theoretical time
complexity per accepted sample as O(M) (M is the reciprocal
of the acceptance rate conditioned on the gathered inequality
constraints dened in Denition 4.3). Alg. 3 calculates the
intersection of the union over a constant number of samples
and thus possesses a time complexity of O(1). For Alg. 4,
since we are using a linear state-space model as dened in
Eq. (39), which leads to a convex QP problem that can be
efciently solved, the MPC planner runs at 30Hz.
