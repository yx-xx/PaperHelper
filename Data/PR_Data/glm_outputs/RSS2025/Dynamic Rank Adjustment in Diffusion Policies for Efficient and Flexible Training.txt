, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The results indicate that r = 256
min
achieves the best balance between training efficiency and policy performance, as it achieves the lowest training time while maintaining
a high success rate. This finding is consistent with the results from the
r = 256
min
previous ablation study, further validating the effectiveness of the
r = 256
min
proposed framework. The results also show that r = 256
min
is robust across different tasks, indicating that this value is a robust
r = 256
