the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data, we used the ADIS16475-2 and STIM320 IMUs, which are both MEMS IMUs with varying precision and cost. The ADIS16475-2 is a mid-range IMU with a cost of $800, while the STIM320 is a high-end IMU with a cost of $8,000. The Hesai Hesai XT32 and Livox Mid-360 are two LiDARs with different characteristics. The Hesai XT32 is a high-accuracy, long-range LiDAR, while the Livox Mid-{
