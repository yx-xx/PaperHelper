AbstractIn this paper, we investigated how the choice of
a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) interface affects communication with a
robot from both the users and the wizards perspective. In
a conversational setting, we used three WoZ interfaces with
varying levels of dialogue input and output restrictions: a) a
restricted perception GUI that showed fixed-view video and ASR
transcripts and let the wizard trigger pre-scripted utterances and
gestures; b) an unrestricted perception GUI that added real-time
audio from the participant and the robot c) a VR telepresence
interface that streamed immersive stereo video and audio to the
wizard and forwarded the wizards spontaneous speech, gaze and
facial expressions to the robot. We found that the interaction
mediated by the VR interface was preferred by users in terms of
robot features and perceived social presence. For the wizards, the
VR condition turned out to be the most demanding but elicited a
higher social connection with the users. VR interface also induced
the most connected interaction in terms of inter-speaker gaps and
and the largest silences. Given these results, we argue for more
WoZ studies using telepresence interfaces. These studies better
reflect the robots of tomorrow and offer a promising path to
automation based on naturalistic contextualized verbal and non-
verbal behavioral data.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Wizard-of-
Oz (WoZ) interfaces where a human operator replaces part
or the entire decision process of a system, are commonplace
, especially in scenarios involving complex social decision-
making or language exchange. Many HRI studies employ
WoZ settings, with humans controlling one or more robot
functions . Yet, the wizards data from these studies, rich
in potential, is often discarded post-study, however, this data
can be invaluable for different applications. Immersive WoZ
interfaces offer a unique opportunity in this regard as they
allow for the collection of rich, context-specific data that can
be used in refining behaviors and decision-making processes.
In this paper, we delve into a comparative analysis of
three different WoZ interfaces, each offering varying degrees
of input and output capabilities that will result in varying
levels of flexibility and control: a) a restricted perception

graphical user interface (GUI) receiving a fixed-view video
stream and automatic speech recognition (ASR) feedback
from the participants, with pre-written utterances and gestures
delivered via synthetic robot voice; b) an unrestricted per-
ception GUI receiving fixed-view video, and real-time audio
from the participant, offering the same output; and c) a VR
interface receiving immersive video and real-time audio, with
unrestricted spontaneous natural speech and gestures. Our
experiment involved 25 users and 5 novice wizards engaging in
5-minute human-robot conversations centered around ethical
dilemmas. Each wizard, controlling the robot via each of the
three interfaces, engaged in three conversations with 5 unique
users in a within-subjects design, resulting in 15 interactions
per wizard (75 in total).
We hypothesize that these interface variations will influence
both the communication efficiency and users preferences
for the robot. In particular, we expect that the interaction
mediated by the immersive VR interface will foster deeper
engagement and perceived social connection, enabling more
natural conversations due to enhanced turn-taking and non-
verbal expression capabilities. Additionally, by assessing the
workload and habituation process across the three interfaces of
the wizards who do not have prior experience operating robots,
we hypothesize the VR interface to provide the most intuitive
control resembling real-life human-human interaction.
The unique contributions of this paper include 1) testing and
sharing a novel VR WoZ interface compared to more common
GUI interfaces; 2) analysis of both users and wizards data,
lacking in prior studies on WoZ methodologies; 3) in-depth
qualitative assessment of novice wizards experience of ac-
quiring different interfaces. Our findings aim to guide future
decisions on WoZ interface design, whether for targeted HRI
studies or paving the path for automation.
II. RELATED WORK
A. WoZ in Conversational Systems and HRI
Multiple studies investigated the intricacies of the WoZ
approach in tasks requiring verbal communication with the
user due to its complexity and sensitivity . A foundational
paper delved into the potential of the WoZ technique to
emulate interactive technologies, with a special emphasis on
speech input and output systems . More than 30 years later,
implementing believable verbal communication still remains a

and transparency .
In verbal communication, there is a great demand for the
wizard to rapidly select and input open-domain content. The

puppetry. Their system leverages a neural TTS system in
near real-time, allowing natural speech input to determine
the output for a specific synthetic target voice. With a high
demand on wizard, in an extended conversation, turn-taking
timing when producing a behavior is particularly important:
response latency in everyday communication is reported to be
universally as short as 200 ms . While a significant line of
research is dedicated to modeling turn-taking in conversational

to face-to-face (FTF) dialogue. They found longer speaker
switch time in WoZ dialogues and more overlapped speech
in FTF dialogues, suggesting tighter turn coordination, but no
difference in speech duration between speakers. Delayed turn-
taking has also been consistently linked to lower engagement
. Thus, we consider it valuable to investigate both the
turn-taking dynamics of WoZ dialogues and the subsequent
impressions of end users and wizards.
Another early study argued that computer dialogue inter-
faces shouldnt merely replicate human-human interactions.

this foundation, a more recent exploration into the dynamics
between humans and various communicative agents, such as
unique challenges each agent presents . This underscores
the significance of robust WoZ simulations specialized for
HRI. A preliminary study with a humanoid robot  observed
that wizards experience difficulties in four different sub-
exploration into WoZ dialogues  further scrutinized the
challenges of emulating natural human dialogues using a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) WoZ approach. While the
interactions were enjoyable for the users, this study highlights
the difficulties of fully incorporating an operators intricate
interaction tactics into dialogue systems with limited dialogue
options. A recent study  examined how the balance
between robotic features and wizards features affects the
perception of teleoperated robots in a supermarket setting.
This study examined degrees of social presence by varying
the robots interaction modes: with or without a wizards
face and with or without conversion to a robotic voice. The
in-between condition, with the wizards face and converted
robotic voice, was perceived as more trustworthy and was
able to maintain longer interactions with customers. This study
highlights the delicate balance between anthropomorphizing
robots and maintaining their inherent robotic nature for opti-
mal user engagement in social interaction scenarios.
B. Virtual Reality (VR) WoZ for Immersive Robot Telepresence
In the domain of Immersive Robot Telepresence (IRT),
the design and efficiency of remote control interfaces play a
crucial role in determining operator performance for remotely
controlled robots. Multiple studies showed that VR-mediated
interfaces can allow high immersivity and efficient, intuitive
task execution. An insightful study compared three remote
control interfaces for mobile inspection robots, particularly
emphasizing the potential of VR devices . The primary
control interface incorporated a VR headset, data gloves for
enhanced gripper control, joystick-based movement controls,
and a motion tracking system to gauge head orientation and
hand positions. The results showed that VR-enhanced inter-
faces significantly boosted operator productivity, heightened
spatial presence, and improved distance evaluation. Notably,
such VR interfaces also reduced the adaptation time for oper-
and comfort levels. In , an operator wore a VR headset and
used handheld controllers to control a Pepper robot by simply
moving their body, allowing for intuitive embodied acting
and efficient robot control with first-person view. The authors
claimed their system could reduce wizard response times
and produce more contextually apt robot behaviors. However,
the system did face challenges such as motion sickness and
lagging movements caused by the slow servos present in
the Pepper robot. They also underscored the need for future
integration of eye-tracking technology, which would elevate
the realism and responsiveness of the robot interaction in social
contexts. Similarly,  utilized a VR headset connected to
the robots camera perspective
