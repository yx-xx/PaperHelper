AbstractThis paper considers multi-robot trajectory plan-
ning for information gathering with intermittent connectivity
maintenance. For information gathering, ergodic search provides
a framework to inherently balance between exploration (visit
all locations for information) and exploitation (greedily search
high information regions), by planning trajectories such that the
amount of time the robots spend in a region is proportional
to the amount of information in that region. Although ergodic
search was studied in different ways, most of them ignore or
over-simplify the connectivity maintenance requirement among
the robots, which is crucial for information exchange in mis-
sions without global communication. This paper introduces a
novel probabilistic measure of inter-robot connectivity based on
the time-averaged statistics of the robots trajectories. Such a
measure provides a new way to impose intermittent connectivity
constraints during the ergodic search, which leads to an optimal
control problem (OCP). We derive the theoretical condition for
optimality based on the Pontryagin principle, and develop iLQR
and augmented Lagrangian methods to numerically solve this
OCP. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed probabilistic measure and demonstrate that the ergodic
search combined with this measure achieves better ergodic
metrics compared to baseline approaches. We also demonstrate
our planner on a multi-drone system.1
I. INTRODUCTION
This paper investigates a multi-robot trajectory planning
problem for information gathering while maintaining inter-
mittent connectivity among the robots, which arises in ap-
plications such as exploration  and search and rescue .
Given an information map, a probability distribution describ-
ing the information density at each location over the area
to be searched, this paper aims to plan trajectories for the
robots to gather information from this map and establish the
robot-robot connection when needed to exchange information.
Existing approaches for information collection range from
complete coverage [3, 4] that uniformly and systematically
covers the area, to information-theoretic approaches [5, 6] that
greedily direct the robot to the next location with the highest
information gain. Different from them, ergodic search [7
9] provides an approach that can inherently balance between
exploitation (greedily moving to high-information areas) and
exploration (visiting all possible locations). Ergodic search
plans trajectories by minimizing an ergodic metric (ergodicity)

so that the time spent in any region is proportional to a measure
of information in that region.
Although multi-robot ergodic search has been investigated a
lot [1014], most of them either ignores the limited connectiv-
ity among robots [10, 11], assuming all robots are connected
with a central communication hub at all times [12, 13], or
require all robots to stay connected with pre-determined and
fixed connection topology . This paper aims to let the
robots determine flexibly when and where to establish con-
nections during the ergodic search, and thus has the potential
to achieve better ergodicity.
Multi-robot information collection with connectivity main-
tenance has been investigated [1520], and the challenge is
to determine when and where the robots should meet and
what topology of the connection should be formed. In general,
connectivity maintenance and information collection are two
competitive objectives in the sense that maintaining connec-
tivity often lowers the efficiency of information collection,
especially when the information is widely distributed over the
workspace and the robots have to deviate from their optimal
trajectories for information collection to build inter-robot
connections. To balance these two competitive objectives,
instead of maintaining the connection at all times [2124],
requiring intermittent connection with either fixed periods
or computed connection schedules [1820] can help improve
the efficiency of information collection.
The idea of maintaining connectivity during ergodic search
in this paper belongs to the broad category of intermittent
to maintain intermittent connection, such as planning recon-
nection paths , searching for other robots to establish
scheduling discrete connection events [1820], we introduce
a novel probabilistic measure for characterizing inter-robot
connectivity based on the time-averaged statistics of robot
trajectories. The proposed measure attempts to avoid explicitly
formulating the connection locations, times, and topologies as
the planning objective or constraints, or imposing any hard
constraints on connectivity. Instead, this paper seeks to infer
the probability of connection among the robots based on the
distribution of their trajectories as the time horizon goes to
infinity. Such a measure provides a way to impose intermittent
connectivity constraints as soft constraints for trajectory opti-
control problem (OCP) that considers both ergodic search and
connectivity maintenance. To solve this OCP, in theory, we
show how to rewrite this OCP into a standard Bolza form,
and derive the condition for optimality based on the Pontryagin
principle. In practice, we provide an algorithm based on the
augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and iterative linear
quadratic regulator (iLQR) that can numerically solve the OCP.
Our experimental results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed probabilistic measure, as we observe a positive
correlation between the value of the measure and the actual
connection time between the robots along their planned trajec-
tories. Additionally, the results show that the ergodic search
combined with our measure achieves better ergodic metrics
than the baseline approaches, and the robots can intelligently
balance between ergodic search and connectivity maintenance
in the long run. Finally, we showcase the use of our planner
on a multi-drone system in a lab setting.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Ergodic Search
Ergodic search optimizes robot trajectories by minimizing
the difference between the time-averaged statistics of the
robots path and the desired information distribution within
a workspace. To quantify this difference, researchers have
developed various optimization metrics. Among them, spectral
multi-scale coverage (SMC)  employs Fourier decomposi-
tion to measure the difference. Kullback-Leibler (KL) diver-
gence metric  approximates the robots spatial distribution
using a Gaussian mixture model. Kernel ergodic metric
extends ergodic search from Euclidean space to Lie groups in
a computationally efficient way. The ergodic maximum mean
discrepancy metric  samples from the search domain to
define the metric and plan ergodic trajectories.
Gradient-based methods are commonly employed to plan
ergodic trajectories by optimizing the ergodic metric. These
approaches include feedback control laws for both first-order
and second-order dynamics in , receding-horizon ergodic
a potential field , the application of differential dynamic
programming (DDP) , and iterative optimization using
linear quadratic regulator (LQR) .
The scope of ergodic search has recently expanded to
encompass various optimization objectives, including time
efficiency . The practical applications of ergodic control
have also diversified, spanning robotic insertion tasks ,
preserving flows measurement , and real-time area cover-
age and target localization applications [12, 13].
B. Connectivity Maintenance
Connectivity maintenance was extensively studied. Contin-
ual connectivity requires all robots to stay connected at all
times globally [2123] or locally , which is suitable for
communication-critical missions. Periodic connectivity
requires all robots to regain connectivity at pre-defined fixed
intervals. Intermittent connectivity [1820] enables the robots
to meet at some locations intermittently over time without
enforcing a fixed time interval between two subsequent con-
Various approaches have been studied to maintain intermit-
tent connectivity. Some methods focus on selecting connec-
tion times or locations, such as searching other robots for
reconnection paths with minimum travel cost , and de-
termining connection times and locations using integer linear
programming (ILP) . Other work seeks to first determine
the connection schedule and then plan the trajectories based
on the schedules [1820].
This paper aims to maintain intermittent connectivity during
ergodic search. Given these advances in intermittent connec-
tivity maintenance, most existing methods cannot be directly
applied to ergodic search, since many connectivity mainte-
nance approaches involve discrete task planning [25, 34] or
sampling-based methods [17, 18], which are challenging to
integrate with gradient-based trajectory optimization for er-
godic search since the optimization objective (i.e., the ergodic
metric) is defined over the entire trajectory. Additionally,
ergodic trajectory planning studies the statistical behaviors of
dynamical systems in the long run, and investigating inter-
robot connectivity based on the statistical behaviors of the
dynamical systems may provide a new planning framework
to intelligently balance between connectivity maintenance and
ergodicity of the system in the long run.

A. Notations
the workspace for all robots, where L R is the bound for
the -th dimension of the workspace W. Let w W represent
a point (location) in the workspace. Let t [0, T] denote the
time variable, where T R represents the planning time
horizon. Let IN  {1, 2,    , N} represent the set of robots,
and superscripts such as i, j on variables denote the associated
robot. Additionally, let R  {(i, j)  i, j IN, i  j} denote
the set of enumerated robot pairs.
Each robot i IN has a state xi(t) X, control input
ui(t) U, and location qi(t) W, where X Rn and
U Rm denote the state space and control space, respectively.
and q(t)  (q1(t),    , qN(t)) WN  W      W denote
the joint state, joint control, and joint location column vectors,
respectively. Finally, let x(t)  f(x(t), u(t)) denote the joint
dynamics of all robots. For notational simplicity, x, u, and q
represent the entire trajectories over [0, T] in this paper.
B. Ergodic Metric
Let (w) : W R
0 denote a time-invariant probabil-
ity distribution function such that
W (w)dw  1, which
describes the information density at each location across the
workspace W. Based on the trajectory qi, the time-averaged
statistics for robot i IN is defined as follows .
ci(w)  c(w, qi)  1
(w qi(t))dt
where (w) is the Dirac delta function such that (0)
and (w)  0, w  0, satisfying
R (w)dw  1. Note that
W ci(w)dw  1 as qi(t) W, t [0, T].
With (w) and ci(w), the ergodic metric (ergodicity) for all
robots is defined as the difference between the time-averaged
statistics of all the robots and the information distribution map
in the Fourier coefficient space as follows .
Fk(qi(t))dt
(w)Fk(w)dw
k and k are the Fourier coefficients of ci(w) and (w),
respectively. k  (k1,    , k) K is the frequency vector of
the Fourier coefficients, and K N represents a selected
set of frequencies in practical computation. Besides, Fk(w)
is the cosine basis function with the
normalization term hk [7, 30, 35]. k  (1k 2
is the weight of each Fourier coefficient.

IV. PROBABILISTIC MEASURE OF CONNECTIVITY
This section first defines the concepts related to the new
probabilistic measure of connectivity between a pair of robots,
and then discusses the intuition behind the measure.
A. Connection Probability
We define the connection area S(w) R for a location
w W as follows. Robot j is connected with robot i at time t
if robot js location qj(t) lies within robot is connection area
S(qi(t)) (i.e., qj(t) S(qi(t))). In this paper, we assume the
connectivity between robots is bidirectional:
Assumption 1 (Bidirectional Connectivity).
If qj(t) S(qi(t)), then qi(t) S(qj(t)).
An example choice of S(w) that satisfies the bidirectional
connectivity assumption is a circular region centered at w with
a fixed radius that remains constant across all robots (Fig. 2).
a trajectory qi, describes the percentage of time that qi stays at
a location wi W within the time horizon T. When T goes
to infinity, ci(wi) describes the spatial distribution of robot i
in the workspace. Specifically, let
(wi)  lim
T ci(wi)  lim
(wi qi(t))dt
denote the spatial distribution of robot i over an infinite time
location wi over an infinite time horizon.
Leveraging the spatial distributions of two robots, we can
infer the likelihood that the two robots are connected within
the infinite time horizon. We introduce a probabilistic measure
of connectivity between any pair of robots (i, j) R as:
Definition 1 (Connection Probability (CP)). Let P(qi, qj)
denote the connection probability:
P(qi, qj)
(wj)dwjdwi (4)
The trajectories qi and qj are independent since each robot has
its own control and dynamics. As a result, the spatial distri-
butions ci(wi) and cj(wj) of robots i, j are also independent
from each other. Note that
(wj)dwjdwi
(wj) represents the joint prob-
ability density of robots i and j being at locations wi and
wj respectively (not necessarily at the same time instant).
all possible locations wi W and wj S(wi), measuring the
probability that robot j lies within robot is connection area
S(qi(ti)) at any time ti over the infinite time horizon [0, ).
Theorem 1. Given the Assumption 1, the connection proba-
bility is symmetric, i.e., P(qi, qj)  P(qj, qi).
Proof. The proof is provided in Appendix A-A.
B. Finite Time Formulation
It is noted that Eq. (4) provides a meaningful probabilistic
interpretation when T approaches infinity (as opposed to a
finite T). When T approaches infinity, ci
characterizes the
spatial distribution of robot i, while P(qi, qj) quantifies the
connection probability between robots i and j.2 However,
planning over an infinite time horizon is impractical in real-
world applications. Hence, we introduce a finite-time approx-
imation of Eq. (4) as:
Definition 2 (Finite-Time Approximation). Let Pc(qi, qj; 0, T)
denote the finite-time approximated connection probability
(FCP), where the subscript c in Pc stands for connection.
Pc(qi, qj; 0, T)
ci(wi)cj(wj)dwjdwi
(wi qi(ti))dti
(wj qj(tj))dtj
(wi qi(ti))
(wj qj(tj))dwjdwi
(qi(ti), qj(tj))dtjdti
2Although the connection between robots requires them to be at specific
locations at the same time, the connection probability focuses on their
spatial distributions while relaxing the temporal simultaneity requirement. It
is investigated in our experiments in Sec. VII-D how this relaxation affects
the connection establishment in practice. We also derive the formulation
considering simultaneity in Sec. VII-E for comparison.
where the Connection Indicator Function (CIF) (wi, wj) :
W  W {0, 1} is defined as:
(wi, wj)
wj S(wi)
otherwise
The transition from Eq. (5a) to (5b) is explained in the next
paragraph. Here, Pc(qi, qj; 0, T) [0, 1]. Specifically, for
and Pc(qi, qj; 0, T)  1 if (qi(ti), qj(tj))  1. For example,
when robot i stays at a stationary location qi W, i.e.,
[0, T], then Pc(qi, qj; 0, T)
qj(tj) S(qi), tj [0, T].
To bridge the transition from Eq. (5a) to (5b), we define
the CIF (6). For any given time points ti, tj [0, T], we can
rewrite the internal double integral in Eq. (5a) as follows:
(wi qi(ti))(wj qj(tj))dwjdwi
(wi qi(ti))
(wj qj(tj))dwjdwi
if qj(tj) S(qi(ti))
otherwise
By the properties of the Dirac delta function (w), the inner
integral over wj Wi evaluates to 1 if qj(tj) S(wi), and 0
otherwise. The outer integral over wi W is equal to 1 only
when wi  qi(ti). Therefore, the entire expression evaluates
to 1 if qj(tj) S(qi(ti)), and 0 otherwise.
C. Sub-Period Formulation
Instead of considering the whole planning horizon [0, T],
sometimes it is useful to evaluate the connection probability
within a sub-period of the planning horizon. Let [t0, tf]
[0, T] denote a sub-period of the planning time horizon. Sim-
ilar to Eq. (5), we can then define the connection probability
within this sub-period [t0, tf] as:
Pc(qi, qj; t0, tf)
(tf t0)2
(qi(ti), qj(tj))dtjdti
As we will see later, to maintain connectivity over a sub-period
[t0, tf], we can either maximize Eq. (8) as an objective or
enforce it to exceed a user-specified threshold as a constraint.
With this sub-period formulation, the intermittent connec-
tivity requirement can be formulated as follows. We divide
the time horizon [0, T] into Np N consecutive sub-periods,
where each period p Ip  {1, . . . , Np} is defined by its start
and end time tp, tp [0, T]. Here, the adjacent sub-periods
are consecutive, i.e., tp  tp1. For each sub-period p, we
constrain its connection probability to be greater than a user-
defined threshold, thereby ensuring a minimum connection
probability among robots over the entire time horizon. The
relationship between the connection probability and the actual
connection status among the robots is discussed in Sec. VII.
V. OPTIMAL CONTROL AND OPTIMALITY CONDITIONS
A. Problem Formulation
Using the ergodicity (2) and the sub-period connection
probability (8), we formulate the multi-robot ergodic search
with connection maintenance (MEC) problem as follows.
Definition 3 (MEC Problem).
rEE(, q)
2uT (t)R(t)u(t)dt
x  f(x, u)
Pc(qi, qj; tp, tp) c, (i, j) R, p Ip
qi(t) qj(t)2 a, (i, j) R, t [0, T]
and the control cost, with a hyper-parameter rE R defining
the weight of the ergodicity, and a positive definite matrix
R(t) RNmNm, t [0, T] defining the weight of the
represent the constraints on the robot dynamics, initial state,
sub-period connection probability, and collision avoidance,
initial state and constraint thresholds. Note that when the
sub-period number Np  1, constraint (9d) is represented as
Pc(qi, qj; 0, T) c.
Remark 1. In Eq. (9d), we impose a constraint on the
connection probability for all pairs of robots, i.e., (i, j) R,
to ensure strict pairwise connectivity. Furthermore, in some
specific pairs of robots, as determined by a predefined con-
nection graph topology [18, 23], e.g., (i, j) {(1, 2)} R.
B. Optimality Conditions
To derive the first-order necessary (local) optimality con-
dition for the MEC problem 3, we first define the Lagrange
function. When the Lagrange function takes the standard Bolza
obtain the optimality condition. However, there are two main
challenges in the formulation of the Lagrange function:
The ergodicity term E(, q) in (9a) contains a quadratic
term defined over the entire trajectories over the time
horizon [0, T] of all robots, rather than just at the terminal
address this, we can reformulate E(, q) as a terminal
term by introducing an auxiliary system state [7, 9, 30].
The connection probability constraint (9d) is defined over
each sub-period p without a stage-wise form, making it
incompatible with the stage cost structure of the Bolza
form. This can be resolved by reformulating the connec-
tion probability constraint as stage-wise constraints by
introducing the instantaneous connection probability.
With these reformulations, we can express the Lagrange func-
tion of MEC problem 3 in the Bolza form, allowing us to apply
the Pontryagin principle to derive the first-order necessary
conditions that characterize a locally optimal solution.
1) Reformulation of Ergodicity: By introducing an auxil-
iary system state, we can reformulate the ergodicity term in
(9a) of the MEC problem into the following terminal form.
Definition 4 (Terminal Form of Ergodicity). Let s(t)
RK denote the auxiliary
system state [7, 9, 30], where each element s(t) is defined
as sk(t)
0 Fk(qi())d tk, then the ergod-
icity (2) can be expressed as:
2sT (T)QKs(T)
with initial condition s(0)  0 and the following differential
s(t)  g(x(t))  1
F(qi(t))
T 2 diag(0,    , kK) RKK represents a
diagonal matrix constructed from the given elements. Addi-
denotes the Fourier coefficient
vector corresponding to the information distribution (w).
F0(w),    , FkK(w)
represents the
vector of basis functions. Note that the summation P
is evaluated component-wise across the elements of F(w). To
simplify the subsequent presentation, we introduce the notation
g(x(t)) to represent the right-hand side expression of Eq. (11).
2) Instantaneous Connection Probability: For sub-period p,
we evaluate the connection probability Pc(qi, qj; tp, tp) by
integrating the CIF (6) over the interval [tp, tp], where the CIF
is a function characterizing the robots trajectories. At any time
instant t [tp, tp], the instantaneous connection probability
can be formulated as follows3.
Pc(qi, qj, t; tp, tp)
(qi(t), qj(tj))dtj
To facilitate the construction of the Lagrange function, we
can reformulate the connection probability constraint (9d) into
an equivalent stage-wise form:
Pc(qi, qj, t; tp, tp)
(i, j) R, p Ip
3) Lagrange Function: The Lagrange function for the MEC
problem 3 is formulated as:
L(x, s, u, x, s, c, a)  rE
2 sT (T)QKs(T)
l(x, u, t)  rcT
c (t)c(x, u, t)  raT
a (t)a(x, u, t)
x (t)(f(x(t), u(t)) x(t))  T
s (t)(g(x(t)) s(t))
where x(t) RNn, s(t) RK, c(t) RR 0, a(t)
RR 0 are the Lagrange multipliers corresponding to
3If t [tp, tp], the instantaneous connection probability equals zero.
constraints (9b, 11, 9d, 9e), respectively. The coefficients
that c(t) is piecewise constant over each sub-period, i.e.,
c 0 for t [tp, tp], p Ip, because (9d)
constrains the connection probability over each sub-period
rather than at any specific time t. The component functions
in the Lagrange function (14) are defined as:
l(x, u, t)  1
2u(t)T R(t)u(t)
c(x, u, t)
Pc(qi, qj, t; tp, tp)
a(x, u, t)
qi(t) qj(t)2  a
where l(x, u, t) R denotes the stage cost, c(x, u, t) RR
denotes the stage-wise connection probability constraints vec-
tor for (9d) over any sub-period p in which time t lies,
and a(x, u, t) RR represents the collision avoidance
constraints vector for (9e), all evaluated at time t [0, T].
For brevity, we define (t)  (c(t), a(t)) and I(x, u, t)
(rcc(x, u, t), raa(x, u, t)) (or simply I(t)) as the concatenated
vectors of multipliers and inequality constraints, respectively.
4) Hamiltonian: Based on the Lagrange function (14), the
Hamiltonian of the MEC problem at time t is defined as:
H(x, s, u, x, s, , t)  l(x, u, t)  T (t)I(x, u, t)
x (t)f(x(t), u(t))  T
s (t)g(x(t))
Theorem 2 (Necessary Optimality Condition). For a locally
optimal control law u and the resulting state trajectory x, the
following conditions must be satisfied:
x  xH  f(x, u) with x(0)  x0
s  sH  g(x) with s(0)  0
s  sH  0
2 sT (T)QKs(T)
rEQKs(T)
u(t)  arg min
u(t)UN H(   , t), t [0, T]
Proof. Pontryagins minimum principle  provides the nec-
essary conditions for a trajectory to be optimal, which consist
of the state equations with initial conditions (Eq. (17a) for
x and Eq. (17b) for s), the costate equations with terminal
conditions (Eq. (17c) for x and Eq. (17d) for s), and the
inequality multiplier equation Eq. (17e). The optimal control
input can be obtained by minimizing the Hamiltonian (16)
within the control space UN, which yields Eq. (17f). The proof
is provided in Appendix A-B.
VI. NUMERICAL APPROACH
The robot dynamics (9b) and inequality constraints I(t)
introduce nonlinearity into the optimization problem. While
the optimality condition (17) provides a theoretical foundation,
directly solving for the optimal control law remains compu-
tationally challenging. Therefore, we propose iterative-MEC
(IMEC), an iterative optimization approach that numerically
solves the MEC problem 3 based on the derivation of (17).
IMEC first converts the MEC problem to the form consisting
of the augmented cost and robot dynamics constraint using the
augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) in Sec. VI-A [37, 38].
linearize the cost and dynamics to define a sub-problem in each
iteration (Sec. VI-B), and iteratively solves the sub-problem
using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for trajectory
optimization [8, 38] (Sec. VI-C). Additionally, a technique to
avoid gradient vanishing is introduced in Sec. VI-D.
A. Augmented Lagrangian Problem
1) Augmented Cost: In Sec. V-B4, we formulate the Hamil-
tonian (16) based on the Lagrange function (14). The optimal
control law is obtained by minimizing the Hamiltonian as
in (17f). To improve convergence and handle inequality con-
straints more robustly, in addition to the corresponding multi-
plier terms in Eq. (14), we add a penalty term for inequality
constraints following the ALM [37, 38]. Let lI(x, u, t), with
penalty coefficient r R, denote the augmented term at time
t containing the multipliers and penalty terms for the integral
and stage-wise constraints (9d) and (9e). Besides, based on
the constraint violation, the multiplier (t)  (c(t), a(t))
can be updated in each iteration using [37, 38]:
rcc(x, u, t)dt
a(t) max {0, a(t)  r  raa(x, u, t)}
During optimization, constraints I(t), t [0, T] are incor-
porated into the cost (optimization objective). Therefore, the
augmented MEC problem is formulated as:
s.t. (9b), (9c) where
J(x, u)  rEE(, q)
l(x, u, t)  lI(x, u, t)dt
B. Linearization
1) Dynamics Linearization: Let x(t), u(t), t [0, T] de-
note the linearized trajectory. The linearized robot dynamics
about Eq. (9b) is formulated as follows:
x(t)  A(t)x(t)  B(t)u(t) with
A(t)  f(x, u)
(x(t),u(t))
, B(t)  f(x, u)
(x(t),u(t))
where x(t)  x(t) x(t) and u(t)  u(t) u(t) denote
the state and control deviations with respect to x(t) and u(t),
respectively. Here, A(t) and B(t) represent the corresponding
state and control matrices.
2) Cost Linearization: We aim to determine appropriate
deviations x and u that ensure the cost (19b) decreases.
mization objective is defined as (ignoring higher-order terms):
J (x, u)  J(x  x, u  u) J(x, u)
The corresponding terms are formulated as follows:
l(x, u, t)  lI(x, u, t)
lx(t)  lIx(t)dt
rEsT (T)QK
F(qi(t))
lx(t)  lIx(t)dt
sT (T)QK
F(qi(t))
lx(t)  lIx(t)
lu(t)  lIu(t)dt
uT (t)R(t)
Note that QK is a symmetric matrix, i.e., QT
With the introduced variables (t) and (t) in Eq. (22, 24),
the optimization objective in (21) can be reformulated as:
J (x, u)
T (t)x(t)  T (t)u(t)dt
C. Iterative Optimization
1) Define the LQR Problem: Given the state and control
trajectories x and u, we can derive the linear formulation of
the objective (21) and linear robot dynamics (20). In each
2xT (t)Q(t)x(t)  1
2uT (t)R(t)u(t)dt
x(t)  A(t)x(t)  B(t)u(t)
where objective (26a) contains both linear and quadratic terms
with cost matrices Q(t) RNnNn, R(t) RNmNm.
Eq. (26b) represents the linearized dynamics, and Eq. (26c)
ensures the state trajectory starts from x0, satisfying initial
condition (9c). This is a typical optimal control problem that
can be solved using Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) .

2) Iterative Solving Approach: Alg. 1 outlines the iterative
solving approach. First, we initialize the multiplier using Eq.
(18) to identify active constraints in I(t), t [0, T] (Line 1).
Note that the linearization trajectory x is derived from the roll-
out process based on the given initial control trajectory u and
the initial state x0. Then, based on current trajectories x, u, we
linearize Problem (19) and apply LQR to solve Problem (26),
obtaining control deviations u (Line 3). Next, we employ line
search to find a control u that decreases the objective (19b)
(Lines 4-5). The multiplier or penalty coefficient is updated
based on the convergence conditions (Lines 7-11). Finally,
we return the state and control trajectories x and u when
the termination criteria are satisfied. Otherwise, the current
state and control x, u are updated (Line 14). In this paper, the
termination criteria are defined as J(x, u) J(x, u) 106
and the sum of inequality violations is less than 0.01.
D. Approximation for CIF
In Eq. (22), there exists a term lIx(t) containing the partial
derivative of the CIF (6) with respect to the state x. However,
this function lacks smooth derivatives, which challenges the
trajectory optimization approach. A possible solution is to
approximate the CIF to obtain smooth derivatives. Let (, )
denote the approximated CIF. In this paper, the connection
area is represented as a sphere (or circle) centered at wi
with connection range Rc for robot i, formally defined as
S(wi) : w wi2 Rc, w W. We consider two
approximated CIFs, and their performance is discussed in Sec.
Gaussian CIF:

Sigmoid CIF:

tude of the gradient. For higher r, the Sigmoid CIF (28)
provides steeper gradients than the Gaussian CIF (27) near
wj wi2  Rc. Therefore, the Sigmoid CIF can potentially
better represent the relationship between connection probabil-
ity and inter-robot distances. Besides, while the Gaussian CIF
provides a coarse approximation, it offers smoother gradients,
which can be important for nonlinear optimization in practice.
parameter r, which is set to 1 for all CIFs in this paper.
VII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This section seeks to answer the following three categories
of questions. First, we examine the effect of the probabilistic
connectivity measure on the optimized trajectories over a finite
time horizon [0, T] in practice. Specifically, we address the
following questions:
Sec. VII-B1: How does increased connection probability
correlate with the actual connection time over [0, T]?
Sec. VII-B2: To what extent does maintaining higher
connection probability affect the information searching
performance measured by ergodicity?
Sec. VII-B3: How different approximated CIFs (, ) (as
discussed in Sec. VI-D) perform in practice?
MEC problem and our planning algorithm influence the re-
sulting trajectories. Specifically, we investigate:
Sec. VII-C: What are the benefits of the sub-period

spatial distributions?

how different algorithms balance between ergodic search and

A. Experiment Settings
1) Parameters: In our experiments, each robot i has the
state xi(t)  (qi(t), vi(t)) and control input (acceleration or
force) ui(t)  (ui
1(t), ui
2(t)), where qi(t) and vi(t) denote the
robots position and velocity in the workspace, respectively.
The robot dynamics is described as a double integrator model:
xi  ( qi, vi)  (vi, ui). For robot i, the initial guess for
the control trajectory ui is set to zero input, i.e., ui  0.
Given the initial state xi
be determined by forward simulation (i.e., rollout). All other
experimental parameters are summarized in Tab. I. Unless
explicitly stated otherwise, these parameters remain consistent
throughout all experiments.
2) Performance Indicators: In this section, we introduce
several indicators to evaluate the experimental results.
Ergodicity E: Lower ergodicity means better information
gathering performance (Eq. (2)).
Average Connection Ratio Rc: Rc measures the propor-
tion of time that robots are connected throughout the
entire time horizon T, which is calculated by:
Rc  E(i,j)R
Et[0,T ]
1(qi(t) qj(t)2 Rc)
where E denotes the average operator and 1() is an
indicator function that returns 1 if the condition is true
and 0 otherwise.
Average Connection Probability Pc: Pc is the average
connection probability (8) over all sub-periods.
Pc  E(i,j)R
Pc(qi, qj; tp, tp)
B. Connection Probability
This section discusses the relationship between average
connection probability Pc and two performance indicators:
average connection time Rc (shown in blue) and ergodicity
E (shown in orange), as illustrated in Fig. 3. This test is
conducted across different information maps (w) (denoted
as Map 1-3) and employs both the Sigmoid and Gaussian
CIF. The additional experimental parameters are: robot number
N  4, simulation steps NT  300, and sub-period number

Np  3. The connection probability threshold in Eq (9d) is
set as c [0.05, 0.5] with a step size of 0.05.
1) Connection Probability over Connection Ratio:
shown by the blue data points in Fig. 3-(I, II), the experimen-
tal results reveal a positive correlation between the average
connection ratio Rc and average connection probability Pc
among the test instances. This correlation suggests that higher
connection probabilities tend to result in increased actual
connection time ratios between the robots. However, it is noted
that the blue dots in Fig. 3-(I, II) do not lie perfectly on the
same straight line, indicating that a higher Pc does not always
correspond to a higher Rc. This is not a surprise due to the
inherent probabilistic nature of the connection probability.
2) Connection Probability over Ergodicity: As shown by
the orange data points in Fig. 3-(I, II), the ergodicity E
increases (i.e., worsens) as the average connection probability
Pc rises for most test instances. The reason is that with a
higher connection probability Pc, the robots need to gather
together more frequently to establish the connection, which
prevents the robots from covering a widespread information
distribution and thus lowers the ergodicity.
3) CIF Approximation Methods Comparison: Comparing
subfigures (I) and (II) in Fig. 3, we observe that the Gaussian
CIF demonstrates slightly better (lower) ergodicity E and
corresponds to a similar average connection time Pc. This
observation aligns with the discussions in Sec. VI-D4.
C. Sub-Period Experiments
1) Varying Sub-Period Numbers: In this sub-section, the
connection probability threshold is set to c  0.2. The
sub-period number Np takes values from the set Np
As shown in Fig. 4, as the sub-period number Np increases,
the average connection probability
Pc generally increases
(subfigure (a)), the average connection ratio
Rc increases
(subfigure (b)), and the ergodicity rises (subfigure (c)). A
possible reason is that, with a higher number of sub-periods,
the robots have to maintain a certain level of connection
probability in each sub-period. It makes the robots gather
together more frequently (i.e., Pc and Rc rise), which, in turn,
prevents the robots from ergodically covering the information
map (i.e., E increases).
2) Impact of Sub-Period Formulation: In this sub-section,
we set the number of robots to N  2 and the connection
probability threshold to c  0.2. We compare the scenarios
of Np  1 (with only one period) and Np  3.
4In the following experiments, unless otherwise stated, the information
distribution is set to Map 1 under the fixed simulation steps NT  300,
and the Gaussian CIF is used.

Comparison of robot trajectories and inter-robot distances for sub-

over time, where Rc and a denote the connection range and the collision
avoidance threshold.
As shown in Fig. 5-(I)-(b), when the connection probability
is constrained to be greater than c over the entire time horizon
[0, T] (Np  1), the robot pairs lose connection during the
time range [0, 10] s, as the distance exceeds the connection
range Rc. In contrast, as shown in subfigure (II)-(b), with
Np  3, the robots establish the connection when each sub-
periods connection probability is constrained to be greater
than c. The reason is that the sub-period formulation divides
the time horizon into intervals of shorter length. Unlike plan-
ning with the entire horizon [0, T], which only considers the
spatial distribution over the entire horizon without considering
meeting at the same time, these shorter intervals are more
likely to make the robots reach certain locations at the same
time and thus achieve better connectivity. This approach
ensures connectivity within each sub-period, preventing long
disconnections.
Combined with the results in the previous sub-section, there
is a trade-off between ergodicity and connectivity: planning
with a large number of sub-periods tends to encourage better
connectivity and worse ergodicity, while having a smaller
number of sub-periods tends to encourage better ergodicity
and worse connectivity.
D. Planning Horizon
In this section, the parameters remain consistent with those
in Sec. VII-C2 (N  2, Np  1, c  0.2), and we fix the
sub-period number Np  1 to study the impact of simulation
steps NT , which takes values NT {100, 200, 300, 400}.
As shown in Fig. 6, as the horizon increases, the trajec-
tory heatmaps of the two robots increasingly align with the
information map, resulting in a decrease in ergodicity (as
indicated by the orange data points in Fig. 7). This observation
is consistent with the definition of ergodic search. Notably, the
trajectories of the two robots do not merely search specific
(partial) peaks of the information distribution; rather, both
trajectories continuously encompass all peaks. This reflects
the role of the connection probability Pc, as we aim for the
robots to accomplish both the ergodic search task and maintain
probabilistic connectivity.
In the meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 7, the average connec-
tion time ratio Rc decreases as NT increases. Compared with
Fig. 6-(IV), although the frequencies of the robots gathering
together at the same location increase, the robots go to the
same location at different times, which leads to a decreasing
Rc. This indicates that as the horizon lengthens, achieving
the same level of connection probability becomes easier while
minimizing ergodicity. For example, this can be achieved
through rapid movement among information peaks, resulting
in the phenomenon of meeting at the same location at
different times.
