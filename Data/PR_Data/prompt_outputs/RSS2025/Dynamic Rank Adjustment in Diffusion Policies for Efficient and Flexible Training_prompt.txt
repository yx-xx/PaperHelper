AbstractDiffusion policies trained via ofine behavioral
cloning have recently gained traction in robotic motion gener-
ation. While effective, these policies typically require a large
number of trainable parameters. This model size affords pow-
erful representations but also incurs high computational cost
during training. Ideally, it would be benecial to dynamically
adjust the trainable portion as needed, balancing representational
power with computational efciency. For example, while over-
parameterization enables diffusion policies to capture complex
robotic behaviors via ofine behavioral cloning, the increased
computational demand makes online interactive imitation learn-
ing impractical due to longer training time. To address this
the Singular Value Decomposition to enable dynamic rank
adjustment during diffusion policy training. We implement and
demonstrate the benets of this framework in DRIFT-DAgger, an
imitation learning algorithm that can seamlessly slide between
an ofine bootstrapping phase and an online interactive phase.
We perform extensive experiments to better understand the pro-
posed framework, and demonstrate that DRIFT-DAgger achieves
improved sample efciency and faster training with minimal
impact on model performance. The project website is available
I. INTRODUCTION
Diffusion policies have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic motion generation, demonstrating im-
pressive performance across various manipulation tasks .
Their strong performance is attributed to overparameterization,
which has been shown to enhance both the generalization and
representational capacity of neural networks . However, this
advantage comes with a signicant drawback, which is the
inefciency of training overparameterized diffusion models
. While the machine learning community has made strides
in addressing this inefciency by leveraging the intrinsic low-
rank structure of neural networks [25, 26], these approaches
primarily focus on ne-tuning pre-trained models [13, 6]. In
making these ne-tuning methods unsuitable.
To exploit the intrinsic low-rank structure, training from
scratch in robotics necessitates a dynamic approach to bal-
ancing the trade-off between overparameterization, which
provides strong representational power, and the efciency
gained from reduced-rank training. Ideally, at the beginning of

Fig. 1: This paper explores balancing overparameterization
and training efciency in diffusion policies by dynamically
adjusting the frozen and trainable portions of weight matrices.
In the top section of the gure, the learner, trained ofine
via behavior cloning with full-rank training, attempts to insert
the upper drawer box into the container but fails due to
collisions with both the container and the lower drawer box.
In the bottom section, after efcient online adaptation with
reduced trainable ranks, the learner efciently improves its
renement. This capability is particularly valuable in scenarios
like interactive imitation learning (IL) with diffusion policies.
Before the adoption of diffusion policies, interactive IL
methods typically used simple and compact network archi-
tectures as policy backbones. These methods were developed
to address the sample inefciency of behavior cloning (BC)
[41, 49], and often involve an ofine bootstrapping stage
for initial training, followed by an online adaptation stage
where experts provide corrective interventions to rene the
policy. However, directly extending these methods to diffusion
policies is impractical due to their signicantly larger number
of trainable parameters, which is often an order of magnitude
greater than those of compact networks and results in substan-
tially increased training times. This challenge undermines the
feasibility of online interactive IL with diffusion policies.
where a large dataset of demonstrations is collected, and
training occurs in isolation. However, when these policies
tions targeting the challenging trajectories, provide corrective
manner. This process is both inefcient and unintuitive, as the
expert often has limited insight into the trajectories where the
policy struggles and may nd it difcult to reproduce such
challenging scenarios.
To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Rank-
adjustable DIFfusion Policy Training (DRIFT), a framework
designed to enable dynamic adjustments of the number of
trainable parameters in diffusion policies through reduced-
rank training. The framework introduces two key components,
which are rank modulation that leverages Singular Value De-
composition (SVD)  to adjust the proportion of trainable
and frozen ranks while maintaining the total rank constant,
and rank scheduler that dynamically modulates the number of
trainable ranks during training using a decay function.
To demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of DRIFT, we
instantiate and implement it into DRIFT-DAgger, an expert-
gated interactive IL method that incorporates reduced-rank
training. As shown in Fig. 2, DRIFT-DAgger uses low-rank
component to speed up training of diffusion policies. By
freezing a signicant portion of the ranks during online adap-
interactive IL with diffusion policies more practical.
Despite being inspired by existing parameter-efcient ne-
tuning methods, DRIFT-DAgger with rank modulation and
rank scheduler is specically designed for training diffusion
policies from scratch and dynamically adjusting the trainable
components during training. This design enhances stability and
reduces the time for forward passes during each training batch
(VI-D). Additionally, we perform extensive ablation studies
on different variants of rank schedulers (VI-A), and mini-
mum trainable ranks (VI-B). By combining diffusion policies
with online interactive IL, DRIFT-DAgger improves sample
efciency compared to training diffusion policies with BC
(VI-C). We also validate our methods in real-world scenarios
(VII). Finally, we discuss the limitations and implications of
our work (VIII). Our contributions are as follows:

II. BACKGROUND
A. Diffusion Policy Primer
A denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) [10, 36]
consists of a forward process and a reverse process. In the for-
ward process, Gaussian noise is gradually added to the training
governed by a predened noise schedule, t, which controls
how much noise is added at each step. Mathematically, the
forward process is dened as:
q(x1:T  x0) :
q(xt  xt1),
q(xt  xt1) : N(xt;
1 txt1, tI),
1 dagger
where q(xt  xt1) is a Gaussian distribution with a mean of
1 txt1 and variance t. Intuitively, this step progres-
sively adds noise to x0, such that by the nal step xT , the
data is almost entirely noise.
The reverse process aims to undo this noise, step by step, to
recover the original data x0. This is parameterized by a neural
t. Using this prediction, the reverse process reconstructs the
data from the noisy input xt:
xt1 p(xt1  xt) : N(xt1; k(xt, (xt, t)), 2
where k() computes the mean for the denoised data at step
t 1, and 2
t is a xed variance term.
In the context of robotics, a diffusion policy  adapts
the DDPM framework for visuomotor control by treating
robot actions as x and conditioning the denoising process
on robot observations, such as camera images or sensor data.
noisy action representation xt and the observations as inputs
and predicts the noise to remove. Architectures like U-Nets
or transformers  are commonly used for . Diffusion
policies are typically trained ofine using BC, where the model
learns to mimic expert demonstrations.
B. Ranks in Diffusion Models
The rank of a matrix, dened as the maximum number
of linearly independent rows or columns , is closely tied
to the expressiveness and representational power of a model.
For example, in linear models, the rank of the weight matrix
determines the dimensionality of the feature space that the
model can effectively capture. Weight matrices with low ranks
often correspond to models with limited capacity but faster
slower training .
In the context of a diffusion policy that employs a U-
Net with one-dimensional convolutional blocks as its network
Rmn can be created by reshaping a corresponding weight
tensor Wconv RCoutCink via
W  reshape(Wconv, (m, n)),
where Cout is the number of output channels, Cin is the number
of input channels, and k is the kernel size. The reshaping can
be performed by setting m  Cout k and n  Cin or other
equivalent view transformations.
The highest possible rank rmax of this weight matrix is
bounded by:
rmax min(m, n).
C. Problem Statement
In this work, we investigate diffusion policies that use a
U-Net backbone composed of one-dimensional convolutional
with weight W and highest possible rank rmax in a diffusion
r of a trainable segment of the weight matrix, Wtrain, for
any r integer satisfying 1 r rmax. We assume all
weight matrices W throughout the network  will vary
uniformly based on r. Importantly, r should remain adjustable
throughout the learning process without introducing instability
or computational overhead.
III. RELATED WORKS
A. Overparameterization and Intrinsic Rank
than necessary to t the training data, is a key factor behind the
success of modern machine learning [21, 16]. Large models
such as diffusion models  and transformers  excel
in tasks like image synthesis , robotic manipulation ,
and language generation . Although overparameterized
models offer impressive performance, their size also poses
signicant challenges for training and ne-tuning due to high
computational and memory requirements.
To tackle these challenges, researchers have observed that
overparameterized models often reside in a low-dimensional
subspace [1, 24, 47]. Pre-deep learning approaches like dy-
namical low-rank approximation  assume a derivable target
matrix is unknown. More modern techniques like Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) [13, 6] ne-tune a small low-rank adapter
while keeping the main model frozen. Although LoRA and its
variants like DyLoRA  and QLoRA  effectively reduces
computational costs, it is primarily suited for ne-tuning pre-
trained models and is less practical for training models from
scratch due to its xed low-rank structure .
For LoRA, the need to merge and re-inject adapters during
rank adjustments and the increased parameters during forward
pass can destabilize training and increase computational over-
head. In contrast, the DRIFT framework dynamically adjusts
trainable ranks without adding new parameters or introducing
instability. By using SVD to partition weight matrices into
trainable and frozen components, DRIFT maintains stability
and efciency, making it well-suited for training overparame-
terized diffusion policies from scratch.
B. Imitation Learning and Diffusion Policy
Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely studied policy learning
paradigm applied to various robotic scenarios. IL involves
collecting demonstration data from an expert and training a
neural network using supervised learning techniques . Be-
fore the emergence of diffusion policies, IL research focused
on improving sample efciency and mitigating compounding
errors through strategic sample collection and labeling .
Ross et al.  rst address these challenges with an it-
tional demonstration rollouts using a suboptimal policy and
renes the trajectories with corrections provided by an expert.
Building on this work, expert-gated [17, 40] and learner-gated
[11, 12] methods allow experts or learners to dynamically take
or hand over control during online rollout collection, which
further improves data efciency.
These methods primarily rely on interactive demonstration
strategies and typically utilize simple neural network architec-
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks [2, 14, 46]. His-
and small MLPs or LSTM, which are constrained by their rel-
atively small number of parameters, limiting the performance
of the learned policies.
Diffusion policies  shift the focus of IL research to
leveraging the representational power of overparameterized
models. Inspired by generative models [10, 36], diffusion
policies use large networks to achieve strong performance in
various tasks. However, the computational demands of these
models create challenges for both training and inference. Few
existing works attempt to integrate interactive IL with diffusion
models [23, 52]. For example, Lee and Kuo  leverage
diffusion loss to better handle multimodality; however, this
work focuses on a robot-gated interactive approach rather
than an expert-gated one and does not contain real-world
experiments. Similarly, while Zhang et al.  employ diffu-
sion as a policy representation, the primary innovation in this
work lies in using diffusion for data augmentation rather than
improving the interactive learning process. Notably, neither
approach addresses the critical issue of reducing batch training
with large models more practical and usable. Recent efforts
to accelerate diffusion policies focus on inference through
techniques like distillation [31, 45], but no existing work
focuses on improving training efciency. As a result, diffusion
policy research remains largely conned to ofine training
scenarios [38, 42, 50].
IV. DRIFT FRAMEWORK
A. Overview
The DRIFT framework is designed to dynamically adjust
trainable ranks in a diffusion policy, allowing the number of
trainable parameters to change throughout the training process.
This exibility enables efcient training from scratch by lever-
aging the intrinsic low-rank structure of overparameterized
models. As covered in II-C, the rank adjustment process
must ensure training stability and avoid introducing additional
computational overhead. These considerations are critical for
training from scratch but are often overlooked by existing
methods like LoRA , which are primarily designed for
ne-tuning. Applying methods like LoRA for dynamic rank
adjustment during training from scratch can result in higher
computational time for forward pass and instability due to the
need for merging and re-injecting newly initialized low-rank
To achieve dynamic trainable rank adjustment while main-
taining training stability, we propose rank modulation. Rank
modulation uses the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
to partition ranks into trainable and frozen sections.
This approach avoids introducing new parameters, ensures
that computational costs for the backward pass decrease as
the trainable ranks are reduced, and maintains a constant
computational cost for the forward pass.
In addition to rank modulation, the framework can incor-
porate a rank scheduler to coordinate the dynamic adjust-
ment of trainable ranks. While rank modulation facilitates
the adjustment itself, the rank scheduler determines how the
trainable ranks may automatically evolve during training. The
rank scheduler uses a decay function that calculates the current
number of trainable ranks based on the training epoch, the
maximum rank, and the desired terminal rank of the policy.
The rank modulation and rank scheduler components can
work together to enable efcient training of diffusion policies
by dynamically balancing representational power and compu-
tational efciency.
B. Rank Modulation
Rank modulation takes inspiration from LoRA , which
employs an adapter with small trainable ranks during ne-
tuning. LoRA achieves this by injecting additional low-rank
weight matrices into the network layers, allowing only these
matrices to be updated during backpropagation. For the one-
dimensional convolution blocks in a U-Net architecture used
by diffusion models, LoRA would replace the original convo-
lutional layer with:
ConvLoRA(x)  Wconv x  ((Wup  Wdown) x),
where denotes convolution, Wconv is the original convo-
lution weight tensor of shape (Cout, Cin, k), with Cout and
Cin denoting the output and input channels, and k is the
kernel size. Two low-rank matrices, Wdown RrCink and
Wup RCoutrk, are introduced, where r Cin. A scaling
factor  further controls the magnitude of the low-rank update.
During backpropagation, gradients are computed only for
Wdown and Wup, thus lowering the number of trainable ranks.
Despite these benets, LoRA has several limitations when
applied to IL that trained from scratch. Since LoRA is essen-
tially an approximation of the full-rank weight, it relies on the
main weight Wconv being thoroughly pre-trained. Otherwise,
the low-rank approximation may limit the representational
power of the model and prevent it from fully beneting from
overparameterization. Furthermore, injecting LoRA blocks
adds complexity to the forward pass. Due to the merging of
Wup and Wdown, the additional convolution with LoRA blocks
results in a time complexity of O(Cout  Cin  r  k), which
increases computational overhead proportional to the rank r
compared to the time complexity of the original convolution
O(Cout Cin k). While this computational overhead is often
negligible when ne-tuning a pre-trained model with a rank of
less than 4 , training a model from scratch requires low-
rank adapters with signicantly higher number of trainable
ranks to effectively leverage both overparameterization and
low-rank structure (as we will demonstrate in VI-B). This
increase in trainable ranks amplies the computational cost
associated with r, making it a critical consideration in such
scenarios.
cussed in IV-C), new LoRA blocks must be injected each time
the rank changes, introducing freshly initialized parameters
and destabilizing training. Consequently, repeatedly merging
and reinjecting LoRA blocks is inefcient when the trainable
rank is adjusted on the y.
To address these limitations, we propose rank modulation,
which leverages an SVD structure to decompose weight ma-
trices into components designated as either frozen or trainable
ranks. More specically, consider a weight matrix W Rmn
that can be created from a corresponding weight tensor
Wconv RCoutCink for a one-dimensional convolutional layer
by reshaping, e.g., Cout k becomes m and Cin becomes n (as
covered in II-B). This matrix can be refactored into three
matrices using the SVD:
W  U  V T ,
where U Rmm,  Rmn, V Rnn. U and V are
orthonormal matrices that represent rotations or reections,
while  is a diagonal matrix containing scaling factors. We
can further split U, , and V at a specied rank r to partition
trainable and frozen part of each matrix:
Utrain Ufrozen
Vtrain Vfrozen
weight Wfrozen as:
Wtrain  Utrain train V T
Wfrozen  Ufrozen frozen V T
where frozen
holds smaller singular values than train.
During training, {Utrain, train, Vtrain} are the only parame-
ters that receive gradient updates (rank-r subspace), while
{Ufrozen, frozen, Vfrozen} remain xed.
The procedure described above, converting Wconv into Wtrain
and Wfrozen using SVD and partitioning, is performed at
the start of each epoch if the number of trainable ranks
has changed since the previous epoch. This procedure also
reorthonormalizes the U and V matrices. While it is possible
to reorthonormalize the U and V matrices more frequently
(such as after each gradient update) using QR decomposition,
preliminary experiments showed that this introduced signi-
cant computational overhead without measurable performance
gains (see Appendix IX-A). Therefore, our implementation
defaults to reorthonormalizing only via full SVD at the start
of an epoch whenever the number of trainable ranks changes.
Unlike LoRA, rank modulation performs a single convolu-
tion using the full W  Wtrain  Wfrozen via another simple
view transformation in memory:
Wconv  reshape(W, (Cout, Cin, k)).
standard convolution. Because no additional new parameters
are introduced during the training process, rank modulation
can also preserve stable updates even when the number of
trainable ranks changes.
C. Rank Scheduler
Building on rank modulation, which dynamically adjusts the
number of trainable ranks while maintaining stable training,
we introduce a rank scheduler to further exploit the low-
rank structure. The rank scheduler, inspired by the noise
scheduler in diffusion models that dynamically adjusts the
added noise , is designed to improve training efciency
without compromising performance.
The rank scheduler uses a decay function to compute the
current number of trainable ranks ri based on the current train-
ing epoch index i, and the maximum and minimum trainable
ranks are adjusted depending on the low-rank adapters. For
LoRA blocks and reinstantiating new blocks with the updated
trainable ranks. In the case of rank modulation, this process
entails computing the SVD of W to produce updated Wtrain
and Wfrozen matrices.
In this work, we implement and evaluate four decay func-

and is the oor function.
V. DRIFT-DAGGER
DRIFT-DAgger combines the sample efciency of interac-
tive IL with the computational efciency of low-rank training
interactively.
Algorithm 1 outlines the DRIFT-DAgger procedure. Similar
to previous interactive IL methods, DRIFT-DAgger consists
of an ofine bootstrapping stage followed by an online adap-
tation stage. The process begins with an initial policy N0,
parameterized by a neural network that can adjust the number
of trainable ranks. Although DRIFT-DAgger is proposed as
an instantiation of the DRIFT framework, the adjustment of
trainable ranks can be achieved through any kind of low-rank
adapters other than the rank modulation proposed in IV-B,
such as LoRA.
In the ofine bootstrapping stage, DRIFT-DAgger trains the
policy Ni on an ofine dataset DB over several epochs i using
these methods, DRIFT-DAgger optionally employs a rank
scheduler that gradually reduces the number of trainable ranks
during training. The rank scheduler uses a decay function
based on the epoch index i, along with the highest possible
ranks (rmax) and terminal trainable ranks (rmin) for the policy
network. This approach reduces computational costs while
maintaining performance. Details of the rank scheduler are
presented in IV-C.
If the rank scheduler is not used, the number of trainable
ranks is set xed at rmin after ofine bootstrapping and before
transitioning to the online adaptation stage. At the end of
ofine bootstrapping, the ofine dataset DB is merged into
a global dataset D for further use in online adaptation.
During the online adaptation stage, the learner policy inter-
acts with the environment through rollouts. At each iteration
expert policy exp detects that the learner has deviated from
the desired trajectory, the expert intervenes, taking control to
provide corrective demonstrations. The expert can be a human
demonstrations are recorded in a dataset specic to the current
rollout Dj. After each rollout, Dj is merged into the global
dataset D, and the learner policy NIj is updated using the
expanded dataset D.
The full procedure of DRIFT-DAgger leverages low-rank
training and online interaction to achieve better sample and
training efciency.

interactive methods like HG-DAgger  and DRIFT-DAgger,
we implement BC with an incremental dataset during the
online phase, similar to the interactive loop of HG-DAgger
and DRIFT-DAgger.
A. Decay Functions
To identify the scheduling strategy that best exploits the
benets of reduced-rank training while balancing the trade-off
between training time and policy performance, we evaluate six
variants of four decay functions for the rank scheduler. These
functions dynamically adjust the number of trainable ranks as
training progresses. The decay functions considered include
with steepness parameters  set to 0.1 and 0.5 for exponential
and sigmoid.
We use DRIFT-DAgger with rank modulation and rank
scheduler for this ablation study. We set rmin to 256 for
all DRIFT-DAgger variants. Since both BC and HG-DAgger
employ full-rank training, they should exhibit similar batch
training times. Given that HG-DAgger outperforms BC in
terms of sample efciency, we use HG-DAgger as the
baseline for full-rank training methods.
To assess performance and training efciency across differ-
ent decay functions, we evaluate the policys success rate, with
higher values indicating better task completion. We also track
the step loss during training as a measure of convergence. To
assess training efciency, we record the mean batch training
time per epoch, separately for the ofine stage, online stage,
and their combination, interpreting it alongside the success
rate and step loss.
The ablation study is conducted on a pick-and-place sce-
nario from the Manipulation with Viewpoint Selection (MVS)
tasks . The pick-and-place scenario, as illustrated in Fig. 5,
requires the agent to pick up a green cube and place it in a red
region. All MVS tasks involve two UFactory xArm7 robots2
mounted on linear motors, where one arm has a gripper and the
other is equipped with a camera. Mounted on one end effector,
the camera enables active perception, working in synergy with
the gripper on the other end effector to cooperatively execute
the manipulation task. The state-action space for all MVS tasks
is a reduced end-effector space for the dual-arm system, with
automatically computed camera orientation using an additional
Inverse Kinematics (IK) objective.
The learning process uses 100 ofine demonstration roll-
ations. We plot the experimental results by combining the
number of ofine epochs and online iterations, resulting in
a total of 150 iterations.
The results of this experiment are presented in Fig. 3 and
summarized in Table I. While all decay functions reduce batch
training time compared to full-rank training represented by
Table I. Notably, the exponential decay functions, due to their
aggressive reduction of trainable ranks, underperform relative
to the other variants, despite yielding the lowest mean batch
training time.

decay functions in balancing training time with performance.
We observe that the sigmoid functions, particularly with a
steep decay parameter   0.5, strike the best balance between
training time and policy performance. These functions main-
tain a high number of trainable ranks during the early training
approximation error, as shown in the loss plot in Fig. 3. This

exibility required for online adaptation.
B. Terminal Rank
To explore the effect of different terminal ranks for the
DRIFT framework, we conduct an ablation study by varying
the terminal rank rmin in DRIFT-DAgger with rank modulation
and rank scheduler. We use the same experimental task, setup,
and evaluation metrics as VI-A, and use sigmoid decay
function with  set to 0.5 for rank scheduler. The terminal
rank rmin is set to 64, 128, 256, and 512 for comparison.
As shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table II, decreasing
the terminal ranks reduces training time but also impacts policy
degradation occurs due to the diminished representational
power of the model when the number of trainable ranks is
reduced. Compared to reduced-rank methods for ne-tuning,
such as , where ne-tuning with an adapter requires only
4 trainable ranks, DRIFT-DAgger with reduced-rank training
from scratch necessitates a signicantly higher number of
trainable ranks, given that there is a noticeable performance
drop when rmin is set to 64. This is to fully leverage the benets
of both better representation power from overparameterization
and improved computational efciency from intrinsic low

We also run rmin sweep for another MVS task, and the results
follow similar trends as the pick-and-place scenario that rmin
256 provides the best balance of efciency and performance
(see Appendix IX-B).

tasks are the end-effector space with quaternions for rotation.
The MVS tasks include opening a microwave, and the same
pick-and-place scenario we used for previous ablation studies.
The methods we evaluate in this benchmark comparison in-
clude Behavior Cloning (BC), HG-DAgger, and three variants
of DRIFT-DAgger: one that uses LoRA, one that uses LoRA
with rank scheduler, and one that uses rank modulation and
rank scheduler. For methods utilizing rank scheduler, we apply
the sigmoid decay function with steepness  set to 0.5. We
set rmax and rmin to 2048 and 256, respectively, based on the
maximum rank of the diffusion policy and prior ablation study
on the terminal rank. For all methods that use LoRA, we set
the scaling factor  to 1.0. Experimental parameters related
to the interactive mechanism, including the number of ofine
rollouts in DB, bootstrapping epochs I, and online iterations
During the online iterations, we save checkpoints every
20 iterations. Each checkpoint undergoes evaluation with 50
task duration, the number of expert labels, and cumulative
training time are recorded as metrics for comparison. The
success rate is used as the primary performance metric. The
mean and standard deviation of task duration reect how
consistent and certain a trained policy is in completing a
given task. A lower mean and standard deviation of task
duration suggest that the policy is well-trained and converges
better to the desired behavior. The number of expert labels,
when considered alongside the other metrics, provides insight
into the sample efciency of a specic training method. For
expert labels indicates better sample efciency. The cumulative
training time is for reecting the training efciency.
To fairly and efciently evaluate different methods, for
each scenario, we rst train an expert policy using human-
collected data from Mandlekar et al.  and Sun et al.
for robosuite and MVS tasks, respectively. The expert policy
performs interventions when the cosine similarity between the
learner actions and expert actions falls below a threshold, as
detailed in Table III. The thresholds are computed based on
the mean cosine similarity between consecutive steps in the
expert training datasets.
As shown in Fig. 5 and Table IV, DRIFT-DAgger variants
demonstrate a pronounced reduction in cumulative training
time compared to BC and HG-DAgger. Additionally, all
interactive IL methods exhibit superior expert sample ef-
ciency compared to BC, as evidenced by higher success rates
with respect to the number of expert labels. An exception
is observed in the DRIFT-DAgger variant with LoRA and
rank scheduler, where the merging and re-injection of LoRA
adapters destabilize training due to the initialization of new
trainable parameters. In contrast, the DRIFT-DAgger variant
that instantiates LoRA adapters only once during the transition
to the online phase, or the variant that combines rank mod-
ulation and rank scheduler, achieve performance and sample
efciency comparable to HG-DAgger, which consistently uses
full ranks instead of reduced ranks. The benets of interactive
IL are more pronounced in tasks with longer durations. Fur-
combination of rank modulation and rank scheduler, exhibit
good stability and better convergence to the desired behavior of
the task, as indicated by the relatively lower standard deviation
in task duration.
D. Batch Training Time
To better understand and demonstrate the improved training
efciency of DRIFT-DAgger, we conduct an ablation study on
the mean batch training time across all stages. The methods
evaluated in this ablation study include HG-DAgger and three
DRIFT-DAgger variants: one using LoRA, one combining
LoRA with a rank scheduler, and one employing rank mod-

ulation alongside rank scheduler. We use HG-DAgger as the
baseline for full-rank training.
This ablation study is performed using the MVS pick-and-
place scenario, same as VI-A and VI-B. We use 100 ofine
demonstration rollouts, 100 ofine bootstrapping epochs, and
50 online iterations for training. We set terminal ranks rmin
to 256 and use the sigmoid decay function with  set to 0.5
for DRIFT-DAgger variants applied.
The results are presented in Fig. 6 and Table V. We observe
that the DRIFT-DAgger variant with xed-rank LoRA and
the variant with rank modulation and rank scheduler both
achieve success rates comparable to the full-rank baseline,
HG-DAgger. When considering batch training time, the variant
with rank modulation and rank scheduler reduces the mean
batch training time across all stages by 11, demonstrating
improved training efciency without sacricing performance.
achieves an 18 reduction in batch training time compared
to the full-rank baseline.
In contrast, the DRIFT-DAgger variant with LoRA and
rank scheduler also shows reduced training time. However,
the success rate signicantly drops compared to HG-DAgger.
This decline is attributed to the instability caused by merging
and re-injecting LoRA adapters, which is also reected in
the higher step loss observed for this variant. Additionally,
despite the use of a rank scheduler, the batch training time
for this variant is slightly higher than that of the variant with
rank modulation, likely due to the additional computational
overhead introduced by LoRA within the DRIFT framework.
VII. REAL-WORLD EVALUATION
To further validate the proposed DRIFT framework, we
deploy DRIFT-DAgger in three real-world tasks, using a
human teleoperator as the expert. The robotic system for these

simulated MVS tasks. The system comprises two UFactory
xArm7 robots mounted on linear motors, with a gripper at-
tached to one arm and a camera to the other. This conguration
enables simultaneous manipulation and viewpoint adjustment.
The state-action space is a reduced end-effector space, with
the orientation of the camera automatically updated via an
additional IK objective.
The real-world tasks, depicted in Fig. 8, include block
of another; drawer assembling, which involves inserting two
drawer boxes into a drawer container; and drawer interaction,
which requires the agent to rst get rid of a visual occlusion
(cardboard box), grasp a red cube from a cluttered area, place
it in the drawer, and then close the drawer. The blocks and
drawer components are 3D-printed using models from  and
. Training congurations for each task are detailed in Table
over 30 rollouts.
We use the success rate, mean and standard deviation
of task duration, number of expert labels, and cumulative
training time as metrics for the real-world experiments. The
cumulative training time only measures the active computation
during training, and not includes any other events between two
training epochs, such as resetting the robot or recording the
demonstration interactively.
with the simulation experiments. All DRIFT-DAgger vari-
ants show noticeable reduction in cumulative training time.
Interactive IL methods, except the DRIFT-DAgger variant
with LoRA and rank scheduler, achieve similar or superior
performance to BC, with improved sample efciency, as
indicated by a reduced number of expert labels. Despite using
reduced-rank training, the other two DRIFT-DAgger variants
perform comparably to HG-DAgger, which trains in a full-
rank manner. The advantage of interactive methods becomes
more pronounced for longer-duration tasks. For example, in
the block stacking task, which has a mean duration of around
0.45 minutes, interactive methods improve sample efciency
by 11.32 to 13.17. In contrast, for the drawer assembling
sample efciency improves by 14.82 to 17.14.
These real-world experiments validate that the DRIFT
framework is effective in real-world settings, offering reduced
training time, improved sample efciency and robust perfor-
mance despite employing reduced-rank training.
VIII. DISCUSSION
This work introduces DRIFT, a framework designed to
leverage the intrinsic low-rank properties of large diffusion
policy models for efciency while preserving the benets
of overparameterization. To achieve this, we propose rank
modulation and rank scheduler, which dynamically adjust
trainable ranks using SVD and a decay function. We instantiate
DRIFT within an interactive IL algorithm, DRIFT-DAgger,
and show this efcacy of this method through extensive

world settings. Our results demonstrate that DRIFT-DAgger
reduces training time and improves sample efciency while
maintaining performance on par with full-rank policies trained
from scratch.
A. Limitations
This work evaluates and demonstrates the DRIFT frame-
work using DRIFT-DAgger as an instantiation within the IL
paradigm. However, prior to the adoption of large models,
online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches [35, 8] were
also a popular area of research. This work does not explore
the application of the DRIFT framework in the online RL
paradigm. Investigating the potential of DRIFT within online
RL could serve as an valuable direction for future research.
decay functions for the rank scheduler, the current implemen-
tation of dynamic rank adjustment in the DRIFT framework
follows a monotonic schedule. Although we have conducted
ablation studies on decay functions and terminal ranks, the
impact of these design choices is likely task-dependent.
blocks in this work is applied uniformly throughout the U-
Net backbone, even though different blocks may have varying
highest possible ranks. Future research could explore more
adaptive and intelligent strategies for adjusting trainable ranks
to enhance training efciency and performance, as well as
identify suitable decay functions and terminal ranks for sce-
narios beyond those covered in this work.
B. Implications
As discussed in III, prior to the era of large models,
innovations in robot learning primarily focused on learning
processes with interaction. However, the increasing size of
models has resulted in signicantly longer training times, mak-
ing many previous innovations in online interactive learning
less practical due to the time required for policy updates.
While the machine learning community has made progress
in leveraging the intrinsic rank of large models to improve
training efciency, most of these methods are tailored for ne-
tuning rather than training from scratch. This distinction arises
from the availability of foundation models in general machine
scratch to address scenario-specic tasks.
Despite years of research in the machine learning com-
ranks remain relatively underexplored in robotics. This work
introduces reduced-rank training as a means to address the
challenges of training efciency, thereby making online in-
teractive learning methods more feasible in the era of large
models for robot learning. By bridging these gaps, we aim
to raise awareness within the robotics community about
leveraging overparameterization and intrinsic ranks to design
more efcient learning methods while preserving the powerful
representations afforded by overparameterized models.

In addition to the baselines considered in the paper, we
also compare DRIFT-DAgger (D) with QLoRA , and four
additional DRIFT variants: QR (using QR decomposition per
gradient step, FPMO (full-rank ofine, static RM with rmin
256 online), MPLO (RM ofine, LoRA online), and DSR

inferior performance to ours. Also, DIRFT-DAgger with QR
decomposition reduces training efciency signicantly with
negligible performance gains. MPLO perform similarly to
DRIFT-DAgger with RM, further suggesting DRIFT outper-
forms LoRA-based methods due to instability of LoRA from
injection and reinstantiation, and its need for well pre-trained
scratch. FPMO demonstrates slightly worse training efciency
due to full-rank ofine training.
DSR causes model collapse during online adaptation despite
having lower loss due to overtting the last few steps during
denoising. This is likely because it also originates from
diffusion models in image generation , which often assume
well pre-trained models that are unavailable in diffusion policy
context for robot learning.
