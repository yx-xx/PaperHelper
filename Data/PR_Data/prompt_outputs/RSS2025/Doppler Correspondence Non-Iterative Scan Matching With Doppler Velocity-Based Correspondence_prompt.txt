AbstractAchieving successful scan matching is essential for
LiDAR odometry. However, in challenging environments with ad-
verse weather conditions or repetitive geometric patterns, LiDAR
odometry performance is degraded due to incorrect scan matching.
4D LiDAR and 4D radar technologies have provided the potential
to address these unfavorable conditions. The term 4D refers to
point cloud data characterized by range, azimuth, and elevation
along with Doppler velocity. Although 4D data is available, most
scan matching methods for 4D LiDAR and 4D radar still establish
correspondence by repeatedly identifying the closest points between
consecutive scans, overlooking the Doppler information. This paper
correspondenceDoppler Correspondencethat is invariant to
translation and small rotation of the sensor, with its geometric and
kinematic foundations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method enables the direct matching of consecutive point
clouds without an iterative process, making it computationally
efficient. Additionally, it provides a more robust correspondence
estimation in environments with repetitive geometric patterns. The
implementation of our proposed method is publicly available at

I. INTRODUCTION
State estimation is a fundamental component in autonomous
safely [3, 7, 20]. Accurate odometry plays a critical role in
reliable state estimation by tracking the robots movement and
position. Therefore, LiDAR odometry has been extensively
researched to achieve high accuracy and real-time performance,
leveraging its superior precision and detailed environmental
sensing capabilities. However, scan matching, which is essential
for LiDAR odometry, is degraded in adverse weather conditions
such as rain, smoke, and fog . Additionally, most scan
matching methods, which depend on the geometry of the
repetitive geometric structures such as tunnels and highways .
4D LiDAR and 4D radar have shown great potential in allevi-
ating these limitations. Unlike conventional LiDAR, FMCW-
based 4D ranging sensors are more resilient to weather condi-
tions [10, 15]. Moreover, they provide 4D point cloud informa-
tion (range, azimuth, elevation, and Doppler velocity), which
has potential [7, 15] for robust scan matching in scenarios with
repetitive geometric structures.
Existing approaches related to correspondence estimation for
4D point cloud scan matching either rely on heuristic utilization

inherent in point clouds derived from 3D information .
Although FMCW-based 4D ranging sensors provide Doppler
velocity but still the correspondence estimation methods typi-
cally rely solely on 3D information [6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 23].
In this paper, for the first time,  Doppler Correspondence
a simple correspondence that leverages Doppler velocity is
introduced. This correspondence is based on the range and
Doppler velocity of each point. Unlike the iterative closest point

matches point clouds without an iterative process, as illustrated
in Fig. 1, while preserving a reasonable level of odometry
are summarized as follows:
A simple and novel correspondence utilizing Doppler
velocity is proposed for the first time. Geometric and
kinematic foundations of this correspondence are derived;
Doppler Correspondence enables a non-iterative scan
matching. Consequently, it significantly reduces time con-
sumption compared with traditional ICP methods;
Since the proposed correspondence does not depend on
geometric cues alone, it remains effective even in the
presence of repetitive geometric structures; and
Scan matching based on Doppler Correspondence achieves
performance comparable to ICP methods across diverse
scenarios and sensor configurations with less computation
II. RELATED WORK
A. 4D Radar Odometry
4D radar odometry and simultaneous localization and map-
ping (SLAM) methods have gained significant attention due to
their robustness in challenging environments, such as visually
degraded or bad weather conditions. Early work by Doer and
Trommer [3, 4] demonstrated the feasibility of fusing 4D radar
data with inertial measurements to achieve 4D radar-inertial
odometry (RIO). Using extended kalman filter (EKF)-based
through techniques such as RANSAC-based ego-velocity es-
trinsic calibration, which removed the need for tedious pre-
calibration processes. Building on this foundation, Michalczyk
et al. [13, 14] extended RIO methods, incorporating persistent
landmark detection and multi-state estimation frameworks to
improve performance.
More recently, as 4D radar point clouds become more dense,
researchers have focused on optimization-based approaches.
Unlike earlier Kalman filter-based methods, which rely on
sequential state estimation, optimization-based methods aim to
solve the sub-trajectory by considering the global consistency of
sensor data. Li et al.  developed a pose graph optimization-
based 4D radar SLAM framework that utilizes ego-velocity pre-
integration factors to improve robustness in noisy 4D radar data.
Huang et al.  introduced an enhanced RIO that integrates
Doppler velocity and RCS information to filter noisy point
Nissov et al.  tackled the challenges of LiDAR degeneracy
by proposing a LiDAR-4D radar-inertial fusion, leveraging 4D
radars robustness in the fog-filled hallway, while preserving
LiDAR accuracy in well-conditioned environments. Herraez
et al.  presented methods for pose estimation and map
and map filtering to enhance accuracy. Zhang et al.  and
Xu et al.  further advanced 4D radar odometry by modeling
point uncertainty in polar coordinates, integrating into data
association and motion estimation for improved performance
in adverse conditions.
B. 4D LiDAR Odometry
4D LiDAR is an emerging technology that enables Doppler
velocity measurements, offering advantages in environments
with geometric degeneracy or dynamic objects. Several recent
studies have explored the potential of this novel sensing modal-
ity for odometry and SLAM tasks. Wu et al.  introduced the
first continuous-time 4D LiDAR-only odometry method lever-
aging Doppler velocity measurements. Their method employs
Gaussian process regression to estimate vehicle trajectories
and correct motion distortion caused by scanning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Similarly, Hexsel et al.  pro-
posed DICP, which integrates Doppler velocity measurements
into the ICP framework for robust point cloud registration. By
jointly optimizing Doppler and geometric objective functions,
their method demonstrated improved registration accuracy and
convergence speed, particularly in featureless environments such
as tunnels and hallways. Yoon et al.  and Lisus et al.
developed correspondence-free methods that estimate 6-DOF
velocity directly from Doppler information without requiring
explicit scan matching and incorporate multiple sensors or
complementary modules such as IMUs or gyroscopes for full
motion estimation.
C. Summary and Limitations of 4D Radar  LiDAR Odometry
The 4D information of FMCW 4D LiDAR and 4D radar
has leveraged its advantages in three main directions. First,
Doppler velocity has been effectively incorporated into opti-
mization frameworks to improve accuracy and robustness in
challenging environments, such as repetitive geometric settings,
foggy conditions, or a significant number of dynamic objects [3,
have been developed by refining point correspondences, using
RCS information  or the uncertainty of point clouds .
recover full 6-DOF motion from Doppler information without
relying on point correspondences.
While recent advances have shown promising results, most
existing correspondence-based methods still rely solely on 3D
geometric information, overlooking the rich Doppler velocity
available in 4D LiDAR or radar data. Also, correspondence-
free approaches estimate 6-DOF motion directly from Doppler
measurements but suffer from limited rotational observability,
requiring multiple LiDAR sensors or an additional gyroscope
to compensate. In this work, we address these limitations by
proposing a novel correspondence formulation that explicitly
leverages Doppler information. Unlike prior methods, our ap-
proach associates Doppler measurements not only with transla-
tional motion but also with rotational motion from a single 4D
The remaining sections are organized as follows. In Sec-
tion III, Doppler Correspondence is introduced in detail, in-
cluding its geometric derivation and the rationale behind its
robustness in repetitive geometric environments. Section IV
presents the experimental results, demonstrating the effective-
ness of the proposed method across various datasets and com-
paring its performance against point-to-point ICP and DICP.
In Section V, the limitations of the approach are introduced,
addressing scenarios where the method may face challenges. In
Section VI, Doppler Correspondence is integrated with ICP to
compare its performance with ICP and DICP, demonstrating
its potential applicability. Finally, Section VII provides the
its potential for the field of 4D ranging sensor-based odometry.
III. METHODOLOGY
A. Problem Definition
ICP is a widely used method for point cloud registration,
aiming to estimate the relative transformation between two
consecutive scans. Let us consider two consecutive point cloud
P and Q contain N and M points, respectively. Assume the
sensor undergoes a rotation R SO(3) and a translation
t R3 between scans. To estimate R and t, the three-
step process is applied iteratively as below.
1) Initialization: The initial predictions for the rotation R
and translation t are set to I33 and
respectively.
2) Correspondence Estimation: Identify correspondences C
by determining the closest points between the two point
cloud scans.

3) Optimization: Compute R and t that minimize the
following loss function:
(R, t)  arg min
q (Rp  t)2.
4) Update: Update the R, t and source point cloud P:

on the spatial information of each point cloud. Relying only on
the spatial information in Correspondence Estimation makes
registration prone to degradation in environments with repetitive
geometric structures [7, 15] or when consecutive scans fail to
capture the same spatial points due to its sparse and noisy char-
acteristics . To address these limitations, this study proposes
Doppler Correspondence for the Correspondence Estimation,
which is explained from the following in detail.
B. Geometric Derivation of Doppler Correspondence
Let us denote points pi P and qj Q are the true
corresponding points, represented as:
let vp,i and vq,j be the Doppler velocity of each point. Assuming
PQ into radial
(r) and tangential () components yields:
Fig. 3: Two corresponding points across consecutive scans. The
radial and tangential velocity components form the basis of our
Doppler Correspondence derivation.
RQ represent the radial and tangential compo-
V is the average velocity over
V p,r and
are the radial and tangential velocities at point pi, respectively.
Using the similarity condition POH QOR (i.e., side-
angle-side similarity), the following proportional relationship
Expanding this gives:
Substituting
OP  rp,i,
OQ  rq,j,
PR  vp,iT, and
HQ  vq,jT, where rp,i and rq,j are the ranges of pi and
qj respectively, and vp,i and vq,j are their respective Doppler
Rearranging and simplifying the above equation yields:
This can be expressed as:
f(pi, vp,i)  g(qj, vq,j).
Note that the above relationship, termed as Doppler Correspon-
depends only on the information from point pi, while the right-
hand side, g(qj, vq,j), depends only on the information from
point qj. Furthermore, since there are no terms involving the t,
this Doppler Correspondence is inherently invariant to transla-
tion of the sensor. Moreover, unlike traditional correspondence
that relies only on spatial (x, y, z) information, this method
additionally utilizes Doppler information. This enables a more
robust and reliable matching process in repetitive geometric
rather than the spatial information from the environments.
C. Kinematic Derivation of Doppler Correspondence
Alternative to the previous geometric derivation of Doppler
matrices and vectors. To establish Doppler Correspondence, we
start with the kinematic relationship from [2, 25]:
radial velocity computed relative to pi and qj, respectively,
while each right-hand side corresponds to the Doppler velocity
measured by the sensor. By clearing denominators, we obtain:
(qj pi)  pi  vp,i T pi2,
(qj pi)  qj  vq,j T qj2.
Adding Eqs. (6) and (7) yields:
(qj pi)  (qj  pi)  vp,i T pi2  vq,j T qj2.
Since (qj pi)(qj pi)  qj2
qj2  rq,j, where rp,i and rq,j are the ranges of pi and qj,
Rearranging terms, we obtain the final form:
which matches Eq. (2).
D. Outlier Rejection
A pair of points pi P and qj Q that satisfy Eq. (3)
can be considered as a correspondence. However, ambiguity
could arise when multiple candidate points, such as qj and its
symmetric counterpart q
j Q with respect to the sensor frame,
satisfy Doppler Correspondence for a single pi. In this case, both
points yield f(pi, vp,i)  g(qj, vq,j)  g(q
Fig. 4(a).
This occurs because g(qj, vq,j) is identical to g(q
as the range and radial velocity of each point is the same
j and vqj
j). Such ambiguity can result in
incorrect correspondence estimation. To address this issue, it
is assumed that correctly matched points pi and qj lie within
similar spatial regions between scans. This assumption enables
the use of a distance-based rejection mechanism to filter out
mismatched candidates, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Similar to the
maximum correspondence distance used in , a threshold
is applied to eliminate unlikely matches. Specifically, both the
spatial distance dspatial  pi qj2 and the Doppler distance
ddoppler  f(pi, vp,i) g(qj, vq,j) should satisfy:
dspatial spatial
ddoppler doppler.
Any pair of points that significantly deviates from these con-
straints is considered an outlier and is removed from the set of
correspondences. By enforcing these thresholds, the impact of
false correspondence estimation is mitigated.

(b) Outlier rejection
Fig. 4: (a) illustrates multiple candidates due to symmetry in
range and Doppler velocity, and (b) shows that the distance-
based outlier rejection method filters out mismatched pairs.
E. Non-iterative Scan Matching Algorithm
In this section, a simple registration method leveraging
Doppler Correspondence is introduced. This method is designed
to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed correspondence for
odometry. The framework is intentionally designed to remain
lightweight to isolate and emphasize the impact of the proposed
Doppler Correspondence. To focus solely on demonstrating
the effectiveness of this correspondence, techniques such as
robust kernels and RANSAC are deliberately omitted from the
algorithm. Further details are provided in Algorithm 1.
The process begins by receiving two consecutive scans, P and
is then performed to estimate correspondences. Unlike the
conventional ICP explained in Algorithm 2, which relies on
3D-based correspondence, our method operates on 1D-based
correspondence. This could reduce computational complexity,
even though f(pi, vp,i) and g(qj, vq,j) need to be calculated.
While this approach may be slightly less accurate than 3D-based
methods due to less information, it offers faster computations.
[1, 7, 16, 17], which iteratively refine correspondences through
multiple iterations, Algorithm 1 performs a direct correspon-
dence estimation in a single step. This eliminates the iterative
search process, significantly reducing the computational load,
as illustrated in Fig. 1. Next section, the feasibility of Doppler
Correspondence is validated by comparing the proposed method
against ICP-based approaches.

1) Sparse 4D Radar: The Campus dataset  is utilized to
evaluate sparse 4D radar point clouds. The data were collected
using a ZF FRGen21 4D radar sensor mounted on the front
bumper of a vehicle. Each 4D radar scan generates a sparse
and noisy point cloud, containing approximately 400 to 1,400
points every 60 ms. The Campus dataset encompasses outdoor
environments featuring trees, vehicles, and pedestrians. These
diverse settings challenge methods to operate effectively under
low-density radar point cloud conditions.
2) Semi-Dense 4D Radar: The Loop 1 dataset from the
NTU4DRadLM dataset  is used to evaluate semi-dense 4D
radar. The data were collected using a car platform with an
Oculii Eagle 4D radar, traversing the NTU campus main roads,
resulting in a 6.95 km trajectory. The car moved at an average
speed of 2530 kmh, and the 4D radar scans exhibit semi-
dense point clouds with approximately 1,000 to 2,000 points
per 80ms. The environment features a mix of structured and
semi-structured regions.
3) Dense 4D LiDAR: The Straight Wall, Curved Wall, and
Baker-Barry Tunnel datasets from  are utilized to evaluate
dense 4D LiDAR. The Straight Wall and Curved Wall datasets,
generated in the CARLA simulator, simulate featureless envi-
ronments by placing large parallel walls along the trajectory.
These datasets provide an effective platform for evaluating
odometry performance, particularly in environments with lim-
ited geometric features and repetitive structures. The Baker-
Barry Tunnel dataset was collected using an Aeva Aeries I
FMCW 4D LiDAR sensor. The point clouds from 4D LiDAR
are significantly denser than 4D radar data, containing approx-
imately 40,000 to 120,000 points per 100ms, depending on the
sequence.
B. Experiment Setup
The proposed method is evaluated by comparing its per-
formance with established methods: point-to-point ICP and
DICP . DICP is a novel algorithm that integrates Doppler ve-
locity into the Optimization in the ICP framework. It enhances
scan matching by jointly optimizing both the closest point term
and additional constraints derived from the Doppler velocity
of each point. These methods are tested in two conditions: No
Seed and With Seed. In the No Seed category, no initial pose
estimate is provided, whereas the With Seed category uses the
estimated pose from the previous scan pair under a constant-
velocity motion model assumption .
For point-to-point ICP, the parameters are set to the following
iteration defines the maximum number of optimization itera-
tions. The method is considered converged when the change in
error falls below the convergence threshold. The point clouds are
uniformly downsampled at intervals determined by the down-
sampling factor, reducing density and computational complexity.
DICP is evaluated using its original parameters from the
open-source implementation. Each value is as follows: maxi-
mum iteration  100, convergence threshold  105, downsam-
pling factor  2, and spatial  0.3.
The proposed method is evaluated with parameters set to
these values: downsampling factor  1, spatial  3, and doppler
5. It does not use maximum iteration or convergence threshold,
as it performs optimization in a single step. All experiments are
conducted on a system equipped with an Intel Core i7-14700KF
C. Evaluation Metrics
The performance is evaluated using the relative error (RE)
from . This metric standardizes trajectory estimation accu-
evaluation measures odometry accuracy through segment-wise
error analysis. This approach provides detailed insights into the
local and global performance of the trajectory estimation. By
using shorter sub-trajectories, RE captures local consistency and
short-term accuracy, while longer sub-trajectories emphasize
global consistency and long-term accuracy. This dual capability
makes RE a versatile and informative metric for trajectory
analysis.
The computation time for transformation estimation, exclud-
ing point cloud pre-processing, is evaluated. A fair assessment
of computational efficiency could be ensured by excluding
computation time for point cloud pre-processing.
D. Experiment Results

the proposed method against the standard point-to-point ICP

excluded due to its failure to produce reliable results on sparse
4D radar data. Under these conditions, closest point corre-
spondence leverages the flow of points  rather than explicit
spatial positions, offering robustness against sparse and noisy
data. As shown in Table I, Figs. 5(a) and (b), and Fig. 6(a),
the proposed method attains substantially higher accuracy than
that of point-to-point ICP. Moreover, unlike point-to-point ICP,
which requires repeated correspondence estimation in 3D space,
our approach simplifies the process to a single-step and 1D
correspondence estimation.
For semi-dense 4D radar point clouds, the proposed method
was tested and compared with DICP. The proposed methods
translation errors exhibited a lower median but higher variance
than those of DICP, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b). Additionally,
rotation errors demonstrated higher median and variance com-
pared with DICP, particularly in sequences with significant rota-
tional motion (Loop1 4). Despite these limitations, the proposed
method achieves comparable performance to DICP in other
scenarios. Furthermore, it offers computational advantages due

to its efficient matching process.
The proposed method is further evaluated on dense 4D Li-
compared with DICP. In static scenarios, Straight Wall, Curved
Baker-Barry Tunnel (Empty), the proposed method
demonstrates comparable performance to DICP while being
significantly faster than DICP. Moreover, the method achieves
lower rotation error than DICP in Curved Wall, possibly due to
the Doppler velocity term in DICP having a limited effect on
constraining the rotational component during the optimization
process. The performance of the proposed method in the Baker-
Barry Tunnel (Vehicles) is degraded due to a significant number
of dynamic objects.
E. Repetitive Geometric Environment
In contrast to traditional closest-point correspondence, which
relies solely on spatial geometry, the proposed approach lever-
ages the simple functions f and g defined in Eq. (3), which
incorporate Doppler velocity. Because these Doppler-based
functions do not depend on geometric cues alone, they of-
fer robust performance even when surfaces appear similar or
repetitive. As illustrated in Fig. 7, this fundamental reliance on
velocity information disambiguates correspondences, providing
accurate alignment in settings where ICP may fail. While the
Optimization process has no difference from other registration

F. Correspondence Visualization
The matching results of Doppler Correspondence and the
closest point correspondence method are visualized on sparse,
tablished after the single iteration are performed, as shown in
Fig. 8. With only a single iteration, Doppler Correspondence
achieves more coherent and consistent matches than the closest
point approach across all levels of point cloud density.

Fig. 8: Visualization of established correspondences after a single iteration in sparse, semi-dense, and dense point clouds.
In the sparse 4D radar point clouds, Doppler Correspondence
generates significantly fewer correspondences than a number
of points, as illustrated in Figs. 8(a) and (d). However, those
correspondences are high quality, leading to better alignment
performance compared with the closest-point method, as shown
in Fig. 6(a). This result aligns with the less is more prin-
ciple discussed in , where using fewer but more reliable
correspondences can be advantageous in highly noisy data.
For semi-dense 4D radar point cloud, while the closest point
correspondence often fails to establish reliable matches, Doppler
Correspondence succeeds in maintaining robust and consistent
illustrated in Figs. 8(b) and (e). For dense point clouds with
repetitive geometric structures (Baker-Barry Tunnel (Empty)),
Doppler Correspondence can produce clear and stable matches
by effectively mitigating the ambiguity that may degrade the
performance of ICP approaches, as depicted in Figs. 8(c) and
V. LIMITATIONS
While Doppler Correspondence, introduced in Section III,
offers notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency
and robustness in repetitive geometric environments, it also
comes with certain limitations. Specifically, the key scenarios
where the method may fail are highlighted below. We also
clarify the main assumptions underlying Eqs. (6) and (7).

A. Key Assumptions and Their Breakdown
For identification of the case where Eqs. (6) and

of translation t R31 and rotation R SO(3) from
the sensor between a time interval T. Suppose pi(T) is the
