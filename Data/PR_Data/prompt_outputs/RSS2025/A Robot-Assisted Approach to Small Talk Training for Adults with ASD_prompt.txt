AbstractFrom dating to job interviews, making new friends
or simply chatting with the cashier at checkout, engaging in
small talk is a vital, everyday social skill. For adults with
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), small talk can be particularly
autonomous robot system that allows users to practice small
talk. Results from the week-long study show that adults with
ASD enjoyed the training, made notable progress in initiating
conversations and improving eye contact, and viewed the system
as a valuable tool for enhancing their conversational skills.

I. INTRODUCTION
Imagine a scene where three coworkers are engaging in
small talk at the beginning of their workday. One of them
is Alex, who has Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a neu-
rodevelopmental condition that often makes it challenging to
understand and interpret social cues .
Hey everyone, hows it going?
Hi! Not bad... just trying to power through this Monday.
How about you, Alex?
Monday is okay.
Good to hear. Anything exciting happen this weekend?
I watched a movie.
Glad you liked the restaurant, Ben. Its my kids favorite
spot these days... What movie did you watch, Alex?
The Martian.
I love that one! Matt Damon is awesome.

At first glance, this brief example of a typical interaction ap-
pears unremarkable. It represents the everyday small talk that
occurs regularly in many workplaces. For workers with ASD,
real challenge. In this example, while Alex responds to direct
responses provide minimal information rather than actively
participating in the flow of the conversation. Additionally,
Alexs lack of response to the last prompt may suggest
difficulty in extending or sustaining the dialogue.
Although workers with ASD are often highly trained and
skilled in job-specific tasks, they frequently face challenges
with social interactions in the workplace. Mller et al.

roles. This underemployment is further highlighted in the

skills are proven to be more significant predictors of overall
success [25, 29, 48]. Hurlbutt  Chalmers  found that
workers with ASD often attributed job-related challenges to
social factors rather than the work-specific tasks themselves.
In their study, one interviewee noted, Jobs usually are 80

is even regarded as a vital skill that should be targeted in
communication therapy for various populations [25, 29, 20].
To better support adults with ASD, it is important to develop
accessible and targeted opportunities for improving interper-
sonal skills, such as small talk. Social robotics has the potential
to enhance existing training initiatives by improving access to
actions [39, 66, 10, 58]. Physically present robots have proven
effective in improving users social abilities [67, 58], provid-
ing benefits such as enhanced engagement, improved social
that are notably more pronounced than those achieved with
non-embodied technologies .
interventions can result in positive and productive outcomes
. Social robots have demonstrated general effectiveness in
enhancing verbal communication skills [33, 62, 31], includ-
ing the ability to engage in everyday dialogue [3, 27, 45].
described such robot-assisted training as relevant and useful
in their workplace experiences [41, 58].
for ASD interventions [66, 67, 58], we developed an au-
tonomous training system that helps adults with ASD improve
their small talk skills. Given the literature on the communica-
tive difficulties of ASD (Sec. II), we begin by examining the
extent to which small talk is considered a desired social skill
(Sec. III). These insights inform our design requirements (Sec.
V) and guide the development of our prototype (Sec. IV). In
that formative study, we investigate initial impressions, percep-
tions of robot-assisted training, and anticipated outcomes for
users with ASD. We then present findings from a week-long,
in-home deployment (Sec. VII), highlighting how users with
ASD received and engaged with the robot-assisted training.
II. RELATED WORK
Atypical communicative behaviors are key diagnostic cri-
teria for ASD , often presenting as limited eye contact,
difficulty understanding sarcasm or abstract language , and
challenges in grasping the social rules that govern everyday
interactions . However, everyday, casual conversations are
a pervasive aspect of daily life, whether it is chatting with
a neighbor about the weather, maintaining friendships, or
making a positive impression on the first day of a new job.
Unlike more structured interactions, which can be formal-
ized to teach more easily as a script [7, 1], small talk demand
quick thinking, social flexibility, and the ability to interpret
subtle cues such as tone, timing, and context. Training to
improve such skills in adulthood presents unique challenges
compared to childhood, as many social habits and patterns
are already established by the time individuals reach adult-
hood . These patterns may manifest in the development
of strategies to avoid social situations entirely ; hence,
the skill development that typically occurs through ongoing
social interaction may not have been fully realized or prac-
ticed. Furthermore, while children have more opportunities for
structured social learning and development through school or
develop these skills [53, 22, 24].
As a result, interventions for adult learners often require
more personalized approaches, targeting specific barriers to
communication and focusing on building confidence in real-
world conversational contexts. Therefore, in this section, we
overview the structure and value of small talk, outline formal
intervention strategies that may inform the pedagogical design
of small talk training, and highlight the potential for robot-
assisted social skills training for ASD. This summary of the
literature ultimately reveals a gap: while there is a recognized
need for small talk skills, there is limited input from adults
with ASD themselves regarding the challenges they face in
adulthood and few opportunities for targeted training. To
address this gap, we conducted a survey to gather insights
from adults with ASD (Sec. III).
A. Structure and Value of Small Talk
While the boundaries of conversation types are fluid, small
talk has a recognized currency in sociolinguistics and com-
munication studies . It refers to informal, light-hearted
exchanges focused on building social connections rather than
conveying substantial detail, often covering general, non-
controversial topics like the weather and hobbies.
Small talk does not have a strict formula, as it is inherently
flexible and context-dependent. However, a typical small talk
dialogue follows the general sequence of conversation, begin-
ning with a greeting and ending with a closing remark, while
emphasizing specific characteristics at each stage [28, 12, 59]:
1) Greetings and openers: Initiating the conversation with
a greeting or commenting on a shared experience such
as the weather or the immediate environment.
2) General topics: Discussing non-controversial and gen-
eral topics such as hobbies, interests, or recent events.
3) Reciprocity: Both participants take turns sharing and
evant participation in the conversation.
4) Closure: The conversation ends with a closing remark,
such as indicating appreciation or a future interaction.
For any individual, the characteristics of small talk highlight
the subtlety and skill needed to navigate this form of conversa-
tion effectively. For adults with ASD, there is a notable overlap
between the challenges inherent in small talk and the broader
difficulties they report facing in everyday social interactions.
We discuss this overlap further in Sec. III.
B. Current Approaches to Small Talk Training
Addressing the unique challenges of small talk for individ-
uals with ASD requires targeted interventions. Although there
are currently no programs focused solely on small talk, many
broader training initiatives include elements that indirectly
support small talk competency. Moreover, while the limited
availability of such training for adults with ASD has not been
widely explored or critiqued in the literature, the following
sections review broader communication programs, which are
primarily focused on children with ASD. We then examine
how these established methods could potentially address the
specific challenges of small talk for adults with ASD.
1) Didactic Approaches: Didactic approaches, or classical
Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), break skills into smaller
components and train each through highly structured, drill-
like practice [50, 17, 15]. While didactic methods have proven
effective in various intervention studies for ASD [78, 13], they
heavily depend on teacher guidance, prompted responses, and
contrived reinforcement methods . An inherent limitation
of didactic methods lies in their tendency to encourage passive
may struggle to initiate communication or apply learned
behaviors beyond the specific training context.
2) Naturalistic Approaches: Contemporary or naturalistic
ABA strives to incorporate interventions into an individuals
everyday environment. While these approaches retain some
level of teacher direction, focusing on predetermined goals,
they emphasize intrinsic reinforcements, such as personal
motivation or social reinforcement. Studies directly comparing
didactic and naturalistic approaches have indicated certain
advantages of the latter, including better retention and broader
application of newly acquired communication skills [14, 50].
Milieu teaching, a subset of naturalistic ABA, integrates train-
ing into everyday environments to effectively promote sponta-
neous communication and initiation in individuals with ASD
[11, 38, 30, 47]. This method encourages skill development
through activities that occur organically throughout the day,
rather than being confined to a designated therapy time.
C. Robot-Assisted Social Skills Training for ASD
There is considerable evidence that technology-driven,
practice-based interactions can enhance social skills in adults
with ASD [9, 58]. However, robots offer distinct advantages
over other technologies by providing a physical, embodied
presence that naturally demands a social response [4, 35].
A socially assistive robot (SAR) may feature human-like
pressions or the ability to make eye contact, both of which
can elicit social responses from users. This presence allows
users to engage in consistent, real-world practice, providing
access to repeatable, co-present social interactions that may
be challenging to replicate with human therapists  or in
Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of
robot-assisted therapy for ASD, with evidence showing im-
provements in a variety of social and behavioral outcomes. For
appropriate social behavior , reduce stereotyped and repet-
itive behaviors , optimize cognitive learning gains ,
and heighten social engagement [66, 52].
While the majority of these studies have focused on chil-
SARs for adults with ASD as well [41, 58]. A robot designed
for social skills training could therefore be a valuable tool
for adults with ASD, offering a safe, consistent, and adaptive
platform for practicing and refining their skills.
III. SURVEY ON THE NEED FOR SMALL TALK TRAINING
To supplement insights from existing literature, we con-
ducted an initial survey to explore the firsthand experiences
and challenges faced by adults with ASD. This needs-finding
survey aimed to identify specific conversational areas where
interventions are not only desired but also deemed most
valuable by this population. We also contextualize the survey
results within existing research on ASD.
Fifty adults with ASD (22 men and 28 women)1, ranging
from 20 to 55 years (M  31.4, SD  10.1) responded to our

male-to-female ratio in ASD diagnoses . This discrepancy may be due
to factors such as increased awareness of underdiagnosis in women, recent
increases in diagnosis rates, or specific recruitment material or methods in
online survey administered on Prolific . All participants
reported having been clinically diagnosed with ASD, either
in childhood (N  18) or adulthood (N  32). The survey
A. Small Talk Skills  ASD
While the survey was designed to broadly explore conversa-
tional skills in the context of adult social interactions, the ma-
jority of respondents emphasized skills closely associated with
small talk. When asked in an optional, open-ended prompt
about which conversational skills they wished to improve,
48 adults with ASD (96) specifically expressed a desire to
enhance skills that are central to small talk interactions. These
reported challenges and desired skills are grouped into five
themes as outlined below.
Difficulty Initiating Conversations. Individuals with ASD
may find it challenging to initiate conversations, particularly
in unfamiliar social situations . Initiating conversations
often relies on subtle social cues, such as recognizing when
to engage, gauging the appropriate timing for greetings, and
responding in a manner that aligns with the context. Among
the adults with ASD surveyed, 27 individuals (54) reported
initiating conversations is a skill they wished to improve.
Limited Interest in Non-Specific Topics. Individuals with
ASD often exhibit a preference for structured and predictable
interactions [54, 51]. The open-ended and non-specific nature
of small talk may be discomforting for individuals who prefer
environments with well-defined rules and expectations.
interest in specific topics or subjects [44, 69], often preferring
in-depth discussions over broad, superficial exchanges. P19
banter quickly enough, so I come across as quiet and serious.
If I dont know someone well enough, I have no idea what
kind of information they would like to receive [...] so I just
stay quiet The preference for depth and detail can make it
challenging to engage in the more superficial content typical
of small talk. Among those surveyed, 20 individuals (40)
highlighted the ability to discuss general topics beyond their
own interests as a specific skill they wished to improve.
Lack of Reciprocal Exchange. Small talk relies on a timely
back-and-forth exchange of information and active listening.
Individuals with ASD often face difficulties in maintaining
reciprocity during conversations, leading to challenges in sus-
taining the flow of dialogue [44, 46, 75, 32]. Among the adults
with ASD surveyed, 39 (78) expressed a desire to improve
their ability to maintain balanced and reciprocal conversations.
Insistence on Topic Sameness. Transitioning smoothly
between different topics or concluding the conversation is a
skill often required in small talk. Adults with ASD may find it
challenging to navigate these transitions, leading to potential
disruptions in the flow of conversation [79, 23]. Among the
adults with ASD surveyed, 18 individuals (36) reported that
smoothly transitioning between different topics is a valuable
conversational skill that they wished to improve.
Social Anxiety. The nuances of social cues can exacerbate
feelings of anxiety, leading to the avoidance of social situations
altogether . Although reporting wanting to improve in
the aforementioned skills, P27 shared, I feel a debilitating
consciousness about my eye contact and posture [...] Even
if I end up talking, Im never sure whether it was the right
thing. Small talk requires maintaining conversational flow
while interpreting nonverbal cues, which can heighten anxiety.
On a 7-point Likert scale (1  highly uncomfortable, 7  highly
comfortable), adults with ASD reported feeling moderately
uncomfortable (M  2.3, SD  1.4). 35 participants (70)
identified managing anxiety as a skill they wished to improve.
B. Methods  Challenges to Improvement
Improving small talk skills is seen as highly valuable by
adults with ASD, as it plays a critical role in fostering social
connections and achieving personal and professional goals. In
an optional open-ended response, 40 of the 50 surveyed adults
with ASD described the value of this kind of informal conver-
sation in specific aspects of their own lives. We conducted a
thematic analysis on their responses, ultimately grouping the
descriptions into three primary themes: making new friends
(60), dating (33), or finding and maintaining a job (60).
Adults with ASD explained that conversations such as small
talk would be useful to getting to know people and keeping
them interested (P16), and in job interviews as [...] you have
to use a specific but casual enough talking structure to be
considered adequate (P25) or socially competent (P48).
dergoing formal training in casual conversations through a
vocational program, an online class, or coaching from a
therapist specialized in interpersonal communication. Despite
actively seeking training, the majority of adults (78) reported
having limited or no formal opportunities (N  10) or relying
on informal methods (N  29), such as improving their
conversational skills through observation or seeking feedback
from friends and family.
serve and deduce the rules from everyday, naturally-occurring
exposure. In free-form responses on the methods that were
most beneficial for conversational skill development, 32 adults
with ASD (64) described learning through mere practice
and observation beyond or absent of any explicit training.
P3 explained that improving in the small talk skills would be
valuable for making friends and going to classes, but part
of the reason I dont do this much is because I dont put myself
in situations where I would meet people.
In summary, small talk presents significant challenges for
individuals with ASD, particularly in initiating, maintaining,
and transitioning within casual conversations. As one partici-
Knowing when you should make conversation, knowing the
unsaid cues of if a conversation should continue or end.
Knowing what to talk about, not saying too much when asked
a question, making sure you ask the next question after. It is a
very mentally draining process where I have to evaluate many
different factors. In fact, nearly all participants (98) in this
preliminary survey expressed a desire to improve specific skills
closely related to small talk. Understanding these challenges
is essential for developing and improving access to effective
interventions tailored to the unique needs of adults with ASD.
IV. FORMATIVE STUDY
A robot for small talk training should possess proficient
small talk ability: balancing conversational succinctness and
generating relevant and open-ended responses. Prior research
has explored the feasibility of developing robots for small talk
interactions . While large language models (LLMs) show
substantial potential for enabling natural language capabilities
in robots, achieving seamless and contextually appropriate
casual dialogue for repeated interactions remains a challenge.
small talk training is to address this challenge and create a
system capable of both generating and evaluating small talk.
Good conversation is believed to arise from the control of
low-level attributes [77, 59]. We implemented a grounded ob-
server modelan LLM instance that observes ongoing con-
versations to evaluate whether responses from the speaking
model adhere to the quantifiable small talk criteria described
in Ramnauth et al. (i.e., brevity, tone, coherence, and topic
non-specificity) . If the generated response aligns with
these criteria, it is relayed; otherwise, the observer generates a
revised system prompt and returns it to the speaking model as
feedback. This feedback redirection allows the system to self-
correct when drifts in conversational behavior are detected.
Our implementation is depicted in Fig. 1.
Prior work has not only showed the inadequacy of an
out-of-the-box LLM for sustaining small talk, but also the
observers robustness in real-time human-robot interactions
. Ramnauth et al.  found that users were dissatisfied
with the baseline LLMs responses, noting its overly assistive
and verbose tendencies, which led to conversations described
as rambling and like speaking to a wall. In contrast,
the observer-enabled system produced conversations that users
described as natural and like a casual chat with someone
you havent met before or havent seen in a long time.
In this present study, we evaluated the robot prototype with
the 50 adults with ASD who participated in our needs-finding
survey (Sec. III). The goal of presenting this early prototype
was to assess whether the observer-enabled small talk reflected
relevant real-world conversations and to determine whether
adults with ASD would be receptive to both the robot and
training. Three randomly selected video excerpts of user
interactions were shown. In open-ended feedback, 84 of
participants (N  42) reiterated the value of practice-based
small talk training for improving confidence (P37), building a
habit of engaging in interactions (P3), and exercising strategies
for handling dynamic situations (P24). Participants also noted
Fig. 1: Grounded Observer. Following the framework out-
lined by Ramnauth et al. , we implemented an observer
model that enables LLMs to sustain authentic small talk
interactions effectively. We then applied this model to a robot,
creating a prototype of the training system, and surveyed adults
with ASD to gather feedback on whether they would use such
a system to improve their small talk skills.
that having the robot at home allows for practice in a safe
environment (P14) with a non-judgmental partner (P33).
having the robot in their homes. P31 noted that, while the robot
offers non-judgmental practice, other people may overhear
my conversations. In light of these concerns, several design
criteria were established. For example, we aim to design a
portable system that operates within a preferred time window,
thus allowing users to control when and where interactions
take place. Additionally, the system should initiate training
only when the user is not engaged in other social activities. The
detectors that enable this functionality are described in Sec.
VI-B. This design must prioritize user comfort and security,
ensuring a personalized and respectful experience. We expand
on our design considerations in the following section.
V. DESIGN GOALS FOR ROBOT-ASSISTED TRAINING
Addressing the specific challenges that adults with ASD
face calls for targeted small talk interventions. This section
lists the core design principles for our robot-assisted training.
A. System Design Objectives
Adhering to the tenets of milieu teaching (Sec. II-C), we
designed a robot for small talk training with these objectives:
In a Natural Setting. The system should be tailored for in-
home training. This enables users to interact without concern
for potential stigma from colleagues. It also eliminates the
need for approval or disclosure of a diagnosis to others.
Realistic Interactions. The robot should offer timely and
responsive reactions to the users communication attempts.
The robot system must deliver authentic interactions that
mirror the appropriateness and style of real-world small talk,
responding in real-time and expressing human-like behaviors,
including naturalistic gaze, movement, and speech. Addition-
scheduled therapy time, but should occur more organically
throughout a portion of the users day.
User-Led Interactions. The robots design should empower
users to take the lead in interactions by responding to their
cues and adjusting its behavior accordingly. A social robot in-
herently facilitates this objective through its physical presence
in the training experience, making it challenging for users to
ignore even non-verbal prompts for interaction [4, 19, 58].
Autonomous Behavior. Training must be entirely au-
adjust or control the system once it is given to the user.
Although similar systems for ASD have been designed for
clinical or laboratory settings where environmental conditions
can be controlled or planned for , the home is a dynamic,
unstructured environment that demands more complex sensing.
B. Training Design Objectives
To design a training method, we break down small talk inter-
actions into smaller, more manageable components and tailor
the training method to the unique needs of individuals with
ASD. Given the challenges of small talk for individuals with
ASD (Sec. III-A), the training focuses on four primary compo-
maintaining a flow of dialogue, and appropriately transitioning
to a new topic or concluding the interaction.
A tiered training method that models the natural flow of
dialogue would sequentially address each component, start-
ing with a simple greeting. The robot responds promptly
and contingently, reinforcing positive behaviors. Progressing
through the tiers, users tackle more complex aspects, such as
introducing non-specific topics or maintaining conversational
flow. This approach, illustrated in Fig. 3, encourages users to
practice the core components of small talk within each training
interaction. Additional considerations include:
Fading Robot-Initiated Prompts. The robot wakes up
from its idling state to draw attention to the beginning of
a training session (Fig. 3-A). In initial interactions with the
eye contact and greet me. As the user becomes accustomed
to the initiation process, the robot gradually minimizes the
verbal prompt: The training window has started. with a less
pronounced emphasis. Over time, it is expected that the user
initiates to interaction without any specific cue (Fig. 3-B).
Relevant Feedback. The robot should offer clear, sup-
portive feedback, highlighting both user successes and areas
for improvement. This encourages users to reflect on their
conversations and identify ways to enhance their skills.
Session Length. The optimal amount of training will vary
among individuals, but a general guideline is to engage in
daily practice. Consistent, short sessions with the robot would
be more beneficial than long, less frequent sessions [68, 80].
VI. SYSTEM
This section overviews the hardware and software com-
ponents that address our design goals (Sec. V) for a fully
Fig. 2: System Hardware. The system has a battery, compact
An external camera and microphone are mounted on a mast.
A. Hardware
Our system consisted of five primary hardware components,
as shown in Fig. 2. We used the Jibo robot , which
stands 11 inches tall and features three full-revolute axes
for 360-degree movement. Jibos onboard capabilities enabled
naturalistic gaze and movement. A compact PC communicated
with other hardware, monitored the system, and served as local
data storage during deployment. An Azure Kinect camera was
mounted 2 inches above Jibos head to maximize the visual
field and audio capture during training.
The system was designed for self-reliance, equipped with a
mobile router that provides a prepaid internet connection for
continuous WiFi and automatic cloud-based data synchroniza-
tion. An uninterruptible power supply served as the charging
station. With these components, the setup was plug-and-play,
requiring only the charging station to be plugged in. To
enhance ergonomic and accessible design, non-interfaceable
components were encased in the container on which the robot
was placed, reducing apparent complexity.
B. Software
We used a modular software architecture when creating the
system to allow for individual components to be evaluated
and improved. To achieve this modularity, we created the
different components of our software as nodes in the ROS
framework . As illustrated in Fig. 1, the system consisted
of several components such as attention tracking of the users,
robot behavioral control, and the generation of small talk
dialogue. These components collectively contributed to small
talk interactions described in our initial study (Sec. IV).
In addition to these components, we introduced components
of training presentation such as the session scheduler and
mechanisms for generating relevant feedback to the user.
Delivering the Training Components. A scheduling node
determined when the system would begin the training window.
One or more training windows could be specified in the sys-
tems configurations. During the training window, the system
would deliver a session, which consisted of engaging the user
in several small talk conversations. At the end of each session,
the system provided feedback, as detailed in Section VI-B.
Recent in-home robot deployments [58, 67, 21] have high-
lighted the importance of ensuring that in-home systems
are capable of discerning when it is socially appropriate
to engage users. These studies have emphasized that, for
effective interaction, the system must recognize contextual
cues that indicate whether the user is in a setting conducive
to engagement or learning. Therefore, we incorporate two
person detection. The Azure Kinect captured video recordings,
and image snapshots were analyzed by a pre-trained YOLO
neural network  to estimate the number of people present.
The Kinect also transcribed audio using Googles Speech-to-
Text API to identify speech content. If speech was detected,
the social presence classifier determined whether it represented
a physically co-present conversation (e.g., a dinner party or
a conversation between friends) or a media interaction (e.g.,
watching television or listening to the radio) . If two or
more people were detected and the audio was classified as
time to engage the user and skipped the planned interaction.
gradually to maintain a consistent number of interactions
within the training window, with intervals selected from a
Gaussian distribution to avoid predictability.
When the system was not engaging in a small talk con-
sleeping to looking down at the floor. When prompted to
wake up, Jibo looked up at the user to signal its availability
to chat. The user could initiate conversation with a greeting,
or Jibo would do so after some time. A linear-logarithmic
growth function determined how long Jibo waited for user
not respond, Jibo would prompt again.
Following a greeting, the system randomly selected 8 to
12 rounds of conversation. It used an observer model (Sec.
IV) to ensure compliance with small talk criteria and monitor
user progress. After the selected rounds are completed, Jibo
transitioned to feedback mode, signaled by changing its LED
ring to blue and adopting a more formal voice.
Generating Feedback. Feedback is essential in any train-
ing. In their study, Ramnauth et al.  found that quantitative
definitions of small talk criteria (e.g., brevity, tone, non-
for generating feedback to the speaking model. However, these
quantitative definitions do not easily translate into practical
feedback for human users.
Effective user feedback should be specific, timely, construc-

good micro- and macro-level feedback. Micro-level feedback
highlighted user successes after each conversation, along with
one area for improvement. For instance, You asked great
questions about my favorite hobbies. I would like to hear
about your hobbies next time. Macro-feedback summarized

overarching insights. For example, You did a great job
acknowledging my interests; I enjoyed your rainy day activity

The study was preregistered and approved by the univer-
sitys Institutional Review Board. Interested adults with ASD
enrolled through the studys website promoted via channels
that required a clinical diagnosis of ASD, such as ASD-
specific residential facilities or employment networks. To
comply with COVID-19 safety protocols, the system was
designed for easy, contactless setup. It was delivered directly
to participants homes with detailed written and video instruc-
tions. Remote support was available via phone or video call,
and at no point did a researcher enter participants homes.
Participants placed the system in a comfortable room and
specified a daily training window of up to three hours. The
study lasted at least seven days, though adjustments were made
for scheduling conflicts. After the study, participants took part
in an interview to discuss their experience with the system, its

accuracy of inputs, such as speech transcripts, before applying
automated measures. Using ELAN , three undergraduate
research assistants annotated the start and stop times for each

initiated by the user to all conversations within a session, and
