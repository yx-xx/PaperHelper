AbstractDespite significant interest and advancements in hu-
manoid robotics, most existing commercially available hardware
remains high-cost, closed-source, and non-transparent within the
robotics community. This lack of accessibility and customization
hinders the growth of the field and the broader development of
humanoid technologies. To address these challenges and promote
democratization in humanoid robotics, we demonstrate Berkeley
Humanoid Lite, an open-source humanoid robot designed to be
The core of this design is a modular 3D-printed gearbox for
the actuators and robot body. All components can be sourced
from widely available e-commerce platforms and fabricated
using standard desktop 3D printers, keeping the total hardware
cost under 5,000 (based on U.S. market prices). The design
emphasizes modularity and ease of fabrication. To address the
inherent limitations of 3D-printed gearboxes, such as reduced
strength and durability compared to metal alternatives, we
adopted a cycloidal gear design, which provides an optimal
form factor in this context. Extensive testing was conducted
on the 3D-printed actuators to validate their durability and
alleviate concerns about the reliability of plastic components.
To demonstrate the capabilities of Berkeley Humanoid Lite, we
conducted a series of experiments, including the development of
a locomotion controller using reinforcement learning. These ex-
periments successfully showcased zero-shot policy transfer from
simulation to hardware, highlighting the platforms suitability for
research validation. By fully open-sourcing the hardware design,
embedded code, and training and deployment frameworks, we
aim for Berkeley Humanoid Lite to serve as a pivotal step
toward democratizing the development of humanoid robotics.

I. INTRODUCTION
Humanoid robotics has gained substantial attention in re-
search and industry, yet its accessibility remains a signifi-
cant challenge. Most existing humanoid platforms are either
commercial products with closed-source designs, high costs,
and limited customizability, or research prototypes that require
specialized manufacturing processes, making them inaccessi-
ble to the broader robotics community. This restricts inno-
in developing, modifying, and testing new ideas. Without
affordable and customizable platforms, progress in fields such
as reinforcement learning for bipedal locomotion, human-robot

reproducible humanoid robot designs is crucial for democ-
ratizing robotics research and accelerating advancements in
humanoid technologies.
Developing an open-source, cost-effective, and fully func-
tional humanoid robot presents several challenges. First,
humanoid robots require complex actuation mechanisms
to achieve smooth and stable locomotion. While high-
performance actuators exist, they are often expensive and
various actuator designs, including planetary gear systems,
belt-driven actuators, and quasi-direct drives, each with trade-
offs in cost, efficiency, and complexity. However, few solutions
provide both affordability and reliability while maintaining
open-source availability. Second, fabrication and assembly
constraints further complicate accessibility. Many research-
oriented humanoid platforms rely on CNC machining, laser
ized manufacturing facilities. Open-source alternatives attempt
to lower this barrier by utilizing 3D printing. Finally, it remains
difficult to ensure durable real-world performance. Humanoid
robots must withstand continuous operational stresses while
maintaining precise motion control. The use of 3D-printed
bility concerns due to material limitations such as reduced
stiffness and wear over time. Thus, designing a humanoid
platform that balances accessibility, modularity, and long-term
reliability remains an open challenge in robotics research.
To address these challenges, we introduce Berkeley Hu-
manoid Lite, an open-source, mid-scale humanoid robot plat-
form designed for accessibility, affordability, and customiz-
ability. Our approach leverages 3D-printed cycloidal gear
mechanical robustness, reducing dependency on expensive,
proprietary actuators. By optimizing the actuator design and
employing widely available components, our platform ensures
that researchers and hobbyists can build and modify the
robot without requiring specialized manufacturing facilities.
To enhance fabrication accessibility, we focus on modular and
scalable design principles. All structural components can be
3D-printed using standard desktop printers, and all electronic
and mechanical parts can be sourced from common online
vendors. This approach significantly lowers the barriers to
entry for constructing and maintaining a humanoid robot,
making it feasible for a wider range of users. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the real-world viability of our platform through
experiments in locomotion and teleoperation. By implement-
ing a reinforcement learning-based locomotion controller, we
achieve zero-shot policy transfer from simulation to hardware,
validating the effectiveness of our actuator design in dynamic
tasks. Additionally, the teleoperation system enables real-time
manipulation tasks, further showcasing the robots adaptability
for research and education. By making the hardware design,
embedded system code, and training frameworks fully open-
Our contribution is to provide an accessible, customizable,
and cost-effective platform, encouraging broader participation
in humanoid development and innovation.

II. RELATED WORKS
Our focus is on open-source, accessible, and customizable
actuators for robotics applications, as well as robot platforms
that can be easily adopted by academic labs and research
A. Actuators
Actuators play a crucial role in robotic platforms, directly
impacting performance, efficiency, and capabilities. Various
design configurations have been explored to optimize robotic
actuators. Katz  developed a fully open-source, high-
tor driver for quadrupedal robots. Their design utilizes an off-
the-shelf motor and a planetary gear component set, requiring
modifications to both the motor and gears, along with a
custom aluminum housing. Gealy et al.  employed belt
reduction systems as modular actuators for the arm. Similarly,
Kau et al.  demonstrated promising results in quadrupedal
robotics by utilizing belt drive and ODrive  as the motor
and lacks modularity. In addition, Grimminger et al.
and Wuthrich et al.  presented a series of open-source
works incorporating belt reduction and custom motor drivers
for small-scale legged robots. Urs et al.  introduced a
3D-printed planetary gearbox combined with the Moteus
motor driver, though their approach requires a resin 3D
printer. Azocar et al.  developed fully open-source actuators
with planetary gearing for prosthetic applications, but their
method necessitates CNC machining. Furthermore, Roozing
and Roozing  investigated the design considerations for
manufacturing cycloidal gearboxes using Fused Deposition
Modeling (FDM) 3D printing. In a subsequent study, Roozing
and Roozing  proposed a non-pinwheel design, optimizing
the form for 3D-printed actuators. Their research highlights
the feasibility of integrating 3D-printed cycloidal drives into
robotic systems.

Research labs have also been developing in-house humanoid
robots that offer high degrees of freedom (DoF) and sub-
stantial torque, serving as advanced platforms for investi-
gating humanoid robot control [13, 22, 27]. More recently,

to a few institutions. Furthermore, these designs often depends
on advanced manufacture techniques such as CNC machining
and laser cutting, which are only available at select academic
institutes. Expensive components are also used which restricts
adaptability and broader adoption. As a result, the need for
specialized manufacturing facilities and expertise significantly
limits the accessibility of these platforms to the wider research
community and hobbyists.
Open-source community projects offers a more accessible
alternative. However, many still depend on custom parts that
requires CNC manufacturing . Other projects, such as
the Poppy Humanoid , OP3 , and NimbRo-OP2 ,
take advantage of 3D printing and utilize servo motors as
the joints. This approach lowers the manufacturing barrier by
enabling fabrication with desktop 3D printers. Nevertheless,
servos typically lack backdrivability and exhibit high reflected
to mid-scale or larger humanoid platforms.
To address these challenges, we introduce Berkeley Hu-
manoid Lite, a modular, mid-scale humanoid robot platform
that emphasizes both accessibility and customization. Berkeley
Humanoid Lite is designed to lower the barrier to entry,
enabling a broader community of researchers and hobbyists
to engage in humanoid robotics research and innovation.
III. SYSTEM DESIGN
A. Overview
The Berkeley Humanoid Lite is a mid-scale humanoid robot
platform that is designed with accessibility and customizability
in mind. The main components of the robot are shown in
Figure 2. The robot weighs 16 kg and stands 0.8 m tall. Two
sizes of actuators, each incorporating a 3D-printed cycloidal
torso is built with aluminum extrusions to support mounting
additional components, and a cellphone-grade IMU is posi-
tioned near the center of the torso.

joint actuators are connected via a 1 Mbps CAN 2.0 bus and
the four buses interface to the computer through USB-CAN
adapters. The IMU is connected over USB through an Arduino
microcontroller. The communication rate to both the actuators
and IMU is configured to be 250 Hz. RL-based locomotion
policies are also deployed on the same computer, with details
provided in Section V-A.
The robot is powered by an onboard 6S 4000 mAh Lithium
Polymer (LiPo) battery that provides approximately 30 min-
utes of operation. Tethering to an external power supply is
also supported for extended testing sessions.
Apart from the non-standard structural parts, which are
printed on a common desktop 3D printer, all components can
be purchased from major online vendors in multiple countries.
These design choices reflect the goal of creating an accessible
and customizable humanoid platform.
B. Performance Factor
To be able to benchmark against other robots and illus-
trate our focus on accessibility and customizability while
maintaining sufficient performance, we adopt the quantitative
performance metric proposed by Shi et al. , with a minor
modification. Specifically, we normalize the metric by the
number of joints, and define the performance factor as the
average peak torque of all actuated DoFs, normalized by the
robots height and weight:
where N denotes the number of actuated DoFs, h and mg
represent the height and weight of the robot, and  max
resents the maximum torque of the i-th joint motor. To incor-
porate cost-effectiveness into consideration, the performance-

per-dollar is then defined as the performance factor divided by
the cost or selling price of the robot:
As shown in Fig. 3, our platform achieves a high performance
factor with a cost lower than 5000.
C. Design Towards Accessibility
A key priority in developing Berkeley Humanoid Lite is
to make the hardware platform accessible to a wide range
of users. To realize this goal, the design process empha-
sizes widely available components, straightforward fabrication
1) Component Availability: Many open-source robot de-
signs depend on specialized components, such as custom
thrust bearings or high-performance motor drivers, which can
be difficult to source. In contrast, Berkeley Humanoid Lite
relies on parts from commonly used online marketplaces,
notably Amazon and Taobao (AliExpress), for most off-
the-shelf elements. Electronic components are obtained from
reputable suppliers such as Digikey and Mouser. By selecting
parts that are broadly available in multiple countries, Berkeley
Humanoid Lite minimizes supply barriers and ensures that
users can acquire necessary materials without extensive lead
times or geographic restrictions.
2) 3D Printing: Recent advances in desktop 3D printing
technology have made Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
more accessible and reliable. Accordingly, Berkeley Humanoid
Lite employs FDM to fabricate all non-standard structural
parts. Polylactic Acid (PLA) is selected as the filament mate-
rial for its robust mechanical properties and favorable printing
characteristics. Although 3D-printed plastic parts introduce
challengessuch as lower material strength, manufacturing
Lite mitigates these concerns by adopting cycloidal gearboxes
in its actuators. Cycloidal gears distribute loads over multiple
teeth and accommodate the limited resolution of desktop 3D
printers more effectively than planetary gears, thus enhancing
reliability . As shown in Figure 4, additional reinforce-
help prevent failures along layer boundaries and bolster overall
load capacity. Certain subcomponents are merged into single

centrations around fasteners. To maintain compatibility with
standard desktop machines, every part is designed to fit within
a 200 mm  200 mm  200 mm build volume.
3) Low Cost: We detail the component costs in the United
States and China to illustrate the affordability of Berkeley
Humanoid Lite. Tables I and II summarize the expenses for
the two actuator designs, while Table III presents the total
cost for the assembled robot. Beyond raw materials, the time
for building and repairing the robot also factors into overall
expense. For Berkeley Humanoid Lite, most off-the-shelf parts
ship within a week in both the United States and China,
custom parts can be printed within a week, and the entire robot
can be assembled in about three days. Broken actuators can
also be easily swapped out and repaired. These considerations
minimize repair downtime and lower the barrier to entry for
constructing and maintaining a mid-scale humanoid robot.
As a concrete example, for the 6512 actuator, we chose
the widely available 6811ZZ ball bearing to define the overall
actuator size. The M6C12 150KV BLDC drone motor from
MAD Components is used to drive the actuator, which strikes
a good balance between availability, performance, and cost.
We then opted for the B-G431B-ESC1 as the motor driver,
favoring its affordability and ready availability at Mouser and
Digikey. Although alternatives like the Moteus Controller ,
tized cost-effectiveness and consistent supply. The housing,
cycloidal gear, input shaft, and output shaft are all 3D printed,
with a brass hex stand embedded in the input shaft to boost
stiffness and improve torque transfer from the motor to the
cycloidal disks.

D. Design Towards Customization
In addition to accessibility, Berkeley Humanoid Lite is de-
signed to be highly customizable. Different research objectives
and tasks may require variations in robot dimensions and joint
straightforward to adapt the robots morphology to suit specific
1) Flexible Configurations: Since each joint in Berkeley
Humanoid Lite is driven by a self-contained actuator with no
additional linkages, adjusting the link length between adjacent
joints is straightforward. As illustrated in Figure 5, extending
the leg links with carbon fiber tubes transforms Berkeley
Humanoid Lite into an adult-scale platform. Joint orders are
also easily interchangeable: while most humanoid robots use
three consecutive revolute joints at the hip to approximate a
ball joint, variations in joint arrangement and orientation can
significantly influence range of motion, power consumption,
and efficiency [42, 43]. Figure 5 also illustrates an alterna-
tive hip configuration that is commonly employed in other
humanoids. By streamlining these modifications, Berkeley
With minimal modifications, the modular joint actuators can
be arranged to form different robot morphologies. Example forms include
quadruped (top-left), biped (top right), Centaur-like (bottom-left), and mobile
base (bottom-right).
Humanoid Lite enables rapid prototyping and comparative
evaluation of different hip designs on real hardware.
2) Different Morphologies: Berkeley Humanoid Lites ac-
tuators require only power and CAN communication, which
allows each CAN bus to support up to 64 devices. This
benefit makes it easy to reconfigure the robot into a variety of
morphologies. Figure 6 highlights examples of a quadruped, a
illustrating how the 3D-printed structure and self-contained
actuators can be adapted for diverse robotic designs with
minimal changes.
IV. ACTUATOR EVALUATION
A reliable actuator is fundamental to the robots overall
performance. To assess the capabilities of our proposed design,
we conducted a set of experiments under conditions identical
to those on the robot, including a 24 V power supply, iden-
tical position PD gains, and matching position, torque, and
current bandwidth configurations. For further verification, we
cross-validated the outcomes obtained with our custom motor
controller and firmware against those produced by an off-the-
shelf Moteus Controller.
A. Power Efficiency
To evaluate the actuators power efficiency, we employed
a custom dynamometer stand (Figure 7). The actuator under
test was operated in torque-control mode, while a secondary
damping actuatorrun in velocity-control modeheld the
system at a constant rotational speed. Torque produced by
the primary actuator was measured with two load cells. An
electrical-power measurement board logged the supply voltage
and current, from which electrical input power was calculated.
Mechanical output power was obtained by multiplying the
measured torque by the measured rotational velocity. Me-
chanical efficiency is defined as the ratio of the measured

measure the torque of the actuator under test, while another actuator acts as
a damper, absorbing the mechanical energy produced by the actuator under
mechanical power to the absolute value of the product of
the commanded torque and velocity, which represents the
efficiency of the cycloidal gear reducer. Total efficiency was
defined as the ratio of the measured mechanical power to the
electrical input power, thereby reflecting the overall actuator
cal losses, and mechanical losses.
We tested the actuator across three different speeds that
correspond to its typical operating range on the robot. Each
torque and speed command was maintained for one second
prior to measurement to minimize transient effects. As shown
in Figure 8, the measured efficiency trends align with previ-
ous findings [17, 36], demonstrating a decline in efficiency
at higher torque and speed settings. The gearbox exhibits
a mechanical efficiency of approximately 90 across most
operating conditions. However, at high torque and velocity,
efficiency decreases due to heat generation.
B. Transmission Stiffness
We characterized the actuators transmission stiffness by
rigidly fixing the output shaft relative to the actuator housing
and measuring motor displacement under a range of static
torques. The torque command was gradually ramped from
0 Nm to 20 Nm and back in both directions. A linear fit was
then applied to the data collected from 4 Nm to 10 Nm, and
the inverse of the slope yielded a stiffness of approximately
319.49 Nmrad (Figure 9). This profile shape is consistent
with previous measurements of 3D-printed cycloidal reducers
reported by Roozing and Roozing , who measured a
substantially higher stiffness of about 1468 Nmrad for a
similar 3D-printed cycloidal reducer. The observed reduction
in stiffness is likely attributable to the lower strength of PLA
compared to the carbon fiber reinforced polyamide (PA-CF)
material used in that study.

C. Durability
A primary concern for any 3D-printed actuator is its op-
erational lifespan. We conducted a 60-hour durability test in
which the actuator repeatedly lifted a pendulum (0.5 kg, 0.5 m)
through a range of -45 degrees to 90 degrees at a frequency
of 0.5 Hz. At one-hour intervals for the first 12 hoursand
every 12 hours thereafterwe paused the test to measure both
efficiency (using the same dynamometer stand) and backlash.
As shown in Figure 10, efficiency initially declined but later
returned to near its original level, aligning with observations
reported by Urs et al. . Although backlash increased
slightly as the 3D-printed parts experienced wear, it remained

within acceptable limits throughout the 60-hour test.
D. Consistency Across Units
The performance might vary across actuator parts printed
under different environment conditions and with different
printers. To demonstrate the consistency of our design, we
performed the efficiency evaluation on six actuators printed on
two different 3D printers. The efficiency and torque tracking
torque error remains within 0.5 N m throughout the operating
range. This confirms low inter-sample variance and confirms
that the actuator design is robust across different fabrication
sources.
E. Position Tracking Accuracy
Gear-backlash is the dominant steady-state source of po-
sition error in our actuator stack. Therefore, we evaluate the
position tracking accuracy of individual actuator modules by
measuring backlash on six freshly printed 6512 actuators. The
maximum observed backlash was 0.0229 rad with a standard
deviation of 0.0042 rad.
To evaluate the system-level performance, we assembled
five actuators into a 5-DoF serial arm and commanded it
to reach four spatial targets (Figure 12). Each target was
repeated 100 times while the end-effector pose was captured
by the SteamVR-based motion-tracking setup described in

V. EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we evaluate Berkeley-Humanoids ability
to perform standard tasks of interest in humanoid robotics
research. To this end, we conduct experiments in two key
A. Legged Locomotion
Our design serves as a robust platform for investigating
humanoid robot locomotion. Notably, we achieve a direct sim-
to-real transfer of an Isaac Gym-trained policy to the physical
robot without relying on additional state estimation methods.
We formulate the locomotion task as a Partially Observed
Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and use a standard Prox-
imal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to learn a control

policy. The policy receives proprioceptive observations from
the robot hardware: (a) the base angular velocity, (b) the
projected gravity vector, and (c) joint positions and veloci-
ties. Additional inputs include the commanded linear velocity
provided by the user and the previous time-step action. The
policy outputs desired joint positions to the joint actuators.
During deployment, the multi-layer perception (MLP) policy
runs onboard the robot at 25 Hz. Figure 14 shows snapshots of
the robot walking in the bipedal configuration under the trained
reinforcement learning policy that follows user-specified ve-
locity commands. Notably, the experiment utilized only 30
of the actuators torque limit, suggesting that the actuators are
operating well within their capacity. This observation implies
that the same actuator design could support a larger humanoid
robotsuch as the example presented in the previous sec-
tionwithout compromising performance.
B. Teleoperated Manipulation
The two 5-DOF arms and integrated grippers enable the
robot to serve as an effective platform for bimanual manipula-
tion research. To demonstrate its capabilities, we implemented
a teleoperation system that leverages a motion capture setup
built with SteamVR base stations and controllers. This system
provides real-time tracking of the global position and orienta-
tion of the operators hand. The SteamVR tracking system was
chosen for its broad support within the OpenXR ecosystem
and its cos
