, we find that CRESTE- In this paper, we introduce CRESTE, a scalable mapless
navigation framework that addresses the open-world generalization and robustness challenges of outdoor urban navigation. CRESTE learns robust and open-set semantic, geometric, and entity-aware representations by distilling features from multiple visual foundation models, enabling it to handle unforeseen factors and dynamic entities. The framework also introduces a counterfactual-based reward learning objective that leverages suboptimal trajectories to improve policy learning and policy alignment. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both seen and unseen urban environments, achieving 70% fewer interventions than the next best method. The paper presents a detailed methodology, including model architecture, training procedures, and evaluation metrics, and demonstrates the effectiveness of CRESTE in real-world scenarios. The framework's scalability and adaptability make it a promising solution for real-world applications in robotics and autonomous navigation.```python
