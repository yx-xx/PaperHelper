I. INTRODUCTION
Imitation learning (IL) has shown significant promise in ad-
dressing complex manipulation tasks [7, 8, 50, 49]. However,
it often necessitates a substantial amount of task-specific data
to train a generalizable learning policy. Efficiently collecting
and ensuring the high quality of such demonstrations remains a
persistent and challenging problem for the robotic community.
Teleoperation is among the most commonly used methods
for collecting demonstrations, often involving the development
of a wide range of devices tailored to meet diverse data acqui-
sition requirements. These devices enable human manipulation
behaviors transfer to various robotic platforms [13, 12, 6, 10,
16]. However, when it comes to dexterous hands, their high
degrees of freedom (DoFs) and inherent complexity impose
even stricter demands on operational precision and the accu-
racy of human motion capture. Hence, it is crucial to design
an intuitive, responsive, and highly precise device specifically
suited for dexterous hand teleoperation applications.

Vision-based methods are primarily used for tracking the
human hand in dexterous hand teleoperation. A simple ap-
proach utilizes RGB cameras [27, 39], but the accuracy
of hand gesture capture is questioned and further limited
by visual obstacles during hand-object interactions. Motion
capture (MoCap) systems [24, 40, 29, 42] provide stable hand
makes intuitive control challenging for the human operator.
Hapticforce feedback offers additional sensory information
beyond vision alone, such as an objects texture, friction, and
softness. Integrating hapticforce feedback into teleoperation
can enrich the feedback available during interaction and enable
the completion of more challenging tasks. Recently, some
commercialized hapticforce feedback gloves [9, 32, 22, 15]
have shown promise for enabling intuitive teleoperation. How-
require significant integration efforts to work with existing
robot learning frameworks.
In this paper, we introduce DOGlove, a low-cost, fully
glove for dexterous manipulation. The glove can be assembled
in hours for a total cost under 600 USD. Key features of
DOGlove include:
21-DoF motion capture: DOGlove features an anthropo-
morphic design resembling the human hand, providing precise
motion capture and a comfortable wearing experience. More-
assembly measuring less than 15 mm in thickness.
5-DoF hapticforce feedback: DOGlove leverages a cable-
driven mechanism to deliver force feedback to each finger
while maintaining a compact and cost-effective design. Addi-
actuator (LRA) to provide realistic haptic feedback. This
integration of force and haptic feedback creates an immersive
and responsive interface for dexterous manipulation.
Action and hapticforce retargeting: We propose a gen-
eral retargeting framework. For action retargeting, the rigid
constraints of the glove allow fingertip positions to be mapped
from the human hand to the target robotic hand. For hap-
ticforce retargeting, the combination strategy enables users
to perceive contact information during teleoperation.
The resulting system, DOGlove, provides precise hand pose
motion capture and the ability to sense interactions with ma-
nipulated objects. This enables human operators to intuitively
and efficiently teleoperate dexterous hands. As shown in Fig. 2,
it further supports the completion of complex manipulation
tasks. We evaluate the necessity of hapticforce feedback
through a user study and further assess the teleoperation effi-
ciency and data accuracy of DOGlove in several quantitative
experiments.

II. RELATED WORK
A. Data Collection from Human Demonstrations
A substantial amount of task-specific data is essential for
imitation learning. In dexterous manipulation, obtaining high-
quality hand motion data is critical for training effective poli-
cies. Prior work includes extracting demonstration data from
human videos [35, 44, 45, 2] and hand trajectories [41, 46].
While these approaches are accessible and have shown promis-
ing results, the significant visual gap between recorded human
demonstrations and the robots perception often makes real-
world transfer challenging. An alternative is using dedicated
hardware for data collection to bridge this gap. Hand-held
grippers [36, 8, 28] have proven effective in capturing robot
manipulation data. However, these systems are primarily de-
signed for parallel grippers. Another widely used approach
is MoCap systems, which record human demonstrations and
extract hand motion data. These systems include camera-based
methods [27, 53, 25], glove-based tracking systems [14, 42,
MoCap solutions [38, 11]. While MoCap offers high-precision
robotic hands remains a persistent challenge.
B. Dexterous Hand Teleoperation
Collecting high-quality human demonstrations
robotic teleoperation systems [12, 6, 10, 16] also plays a
critical role for advancing dexterous manipulation. Existing
research has explored teleoperation from various perspectives,
including leader-follower setups such as ALOHA [50, 51,
significant challenge. OpenTelevision  leverages VR devices
to capture hand poses and streams the pose information
for retargeting to robotic hands. BiDex , on the other
motion capture gloves  and leader arms. Compared to these
frameworks and other glove-based systems [20, 21], DOGlove
offers distinct advantages. It eliminates the need for expensive
equipment while precisely capturing fingertip positions and
delivering richer hapticforce feedback to the operator. This
system achieves accurate dexterous hand teleoperation with a
low-cost setup, making it an efficient alternative.
C. Teleoperation with HapticForce Feedback
While recent studies rely on visual information to capture
environmental characteristics, vision alone inherently limits
the richness of available sensory data. In contrast, hapticforce
feedback enhances the teleoperation experience by providing
greater immersion and improving perception of the robots
status and movement compared to vision-based methods.

equipment. In contrast, DOGlove provides a highly accurate
teleoperation system with integrated hapticforce feedback at
a significantly lower cost and can be widely used in dexterous
manipulation.
III. GLOVE DESIGN OBJECTIVES
DOGlove is designed to precisely capture human hand poses
and provide hapticforce feedback for intuitive teleoperation.
While ensuring these functionalities, the glove is optimized for
accessibility by the research community, focusing on low cost,
ease of manufacturing, and high performance. To achieve these
A. Low cost
Commercial products such as the SenseGlove Nova
and Manus VR  cost more than 5,000 USD, making
them prohibitively expensive for many researchers. In contrast,
DOGlove provides a low-cost solution under 600 USD.
B. Ease of manufacturing
All parts of DOGlove are either readily available for pur-
chase online or manufacturable using standard methods. The
gloves main body can be 3D-printed using a commodity 3D
sourced. The entire glove can be assembled within 6 hours.
C. Performance Sufficiency
To ensure precise fingertip position tracking, the gloves
encoders deliver joint angle data with an error range of 7.2,
which can be further minimized through careful calibration.
For intuitive hapticforce feedback, the servos provide suffi-
cient stall torque to halt human finger movement, while the
haptic engine supports multiple haptic waveforms to enhance
tactile sensations.
D. Low latency
The MoCap system operates at a maximum frequency of
120 Hz, while the hapticforce feedback system achieves a
maximum frequency of 30 Hz. Together with the retargeting
mum frequency of 30 Hz, providing a smooth and responsive
teleoperation experience.
IV. HARDWARE SYSTEM
A. Kinematic Design
The kinematic design of DOGlove refers to the use of con-
straints to achieve desired movements, emulating the natural
motion of a human hand. To ensure precise MoCap capabilities
and a comfortable wearing experience, DOGlove are designed
to closely resemble the anthropomorphic structure of the
human hand.
Several studies [3, 4] model the hand skeleton as a kine-
matic chain, represented by a hierarchical structure of rigidly
connected joints. As shown in Fig. 3, the kinematic structure
of the human hand primarily consists of two types of joints:
hinge joints and ball joints.
In the index, middle, ring, and pinky finger, distal inter-
phalangeal (DIP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints
are hinge joints with 1-DoF, allowing only flexion-extension
movements. In contrast, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint
is a ball joint with 2-DoF, allowing both flexion-extension and
adduction-abduction movements.
The thumb differs slightly in its structure. The interpha-
langeal (IP) and metaphalangeal (MCP) joints are hinge joints

with 1 DoF, while the additional trapeziometacarpal (TM)
joint is a ball joint that supports both flexion-extension and
adduction-abduction movements. To further enhance dexterity,
an additional DoF at the wrist allows the thumb to perform
pronation-supination movements.
To implement these joints in DOGlove, hinge joints are
modeled as two linkages connected by a rotary joint, with
a joint encoder installed on the rotary axis to capture motion.
Ball joints are designed as a combination of two orthogonal
rotary joints, each equipped with a joint encoder on its
respective rotary axis.
The linkage lengths in DOGlove are designed to accommo-
date the majority of adult human sizes. To achieve this, a stan-
dard human finger length was first modeled, and the gloves
linkage parameters were simulated to ensure an optimal range
of motion. As shown in Fig. 4, improper linkage lengths can
obstruct the natural flexion-extension of the fingers, leading
to discomfort and reduced MoCap performance. Furthermore,
DOGlove features a modular design where all fingers share a
common structural framework. This modularity enables users
to replace linkages with customized sizes as needed, enhancing
both adaptability and usability.
B. Finger Design

composed of the thumb, index, middle, ring, and pinky finger

consistent structural elements across all fingers.

to be regulated. Since the actuator is directly connected to
the pulley system as a rotary joint for MCPB, it is essential
to measure its rotary position in real time to achieve precise
joint angle control. Considering these design requirements, the
Dynamixel XCXL330 servo motors were selected as the
actuators for force feedback. It fulfills the torque, size, and
real-time position measurement needs, making it a suitable
choice for DOGlove.
1) Joint Encoders:
To integrate joint encoders into the finger linkages, the
encoders must be compact while maintaining high precision.
5 servo motors to achieve 21-DoF MoCap capabilities, the
cost of each encoder needs to be affordable. Considering
these constraints, we selected the Alps RDC506018A rotary
sensor as the joint encoder. This compact encoder (W11 mm
L14.9 mm  H2.2 mm) is easily integrated into the 3D-
printed joint structures. The encoder operates as a variable
The resistance changes are converted into voltage sig-
nals using a simple voltage divider circuit. Due to the en-
coders linear response, the voltage output is proportional
to the actual joint angle. These voltage signals are read
by an Analog-Digital Converter (ADC) module. For precise
ADC operating at 30k samples per second. The converted
signals are then sent to a microcontroller unit (MCU), the
ST Electronics STM32F042K6T6, which operates at a
clock speed of 48 MHz. To optimize system performance and
reduce OS scheduling overhead, the STM32s Direct Memory
Access (DMA) feature is utilized to accelerate joint encoder
readings. Finally, the processed joint data is transmitted to the
host machine via a serial port on the STM32.
The voltage readings are mapped directly to joint an-
gles under the assumption that the supply voltage of the
STM32 (approximately 3.3 V) corresponds to 360, while the
ground voltage (0 V) corresponds to 0. Using the ADC output
joint  VADC
The primary error in this conversion comes from the lin-
earity error of the encoder which is 2 according to its
datasheet. This results in an angular error of 7.2 when mea-
suring joint angles. To mitigate this, we employ a calibration
process. Using an external high-precision joint encoder, we
map the voltage reading to an actual joint angle, creating a
correction table for each encoder. With this calibration, the
error can be reduced to within 1.
2) Cable-Driven Force Feedback Structure:
Force feedback refers to the feedback derived from applied
forces and torques. To provide force feedback on the human
transmitted to the gloves finger linkage system. As illustrated
in Fig. 5, the rotary axis of the servo and the rotary axis of
the MCPB joint are misaligned. Consequently, a transmission
mechanism is required to transfer the torque effectively.
Although a bevel gear system could serve as a potential
accommodate the two orthogonal gears. Additionally, transmit-
ting large torque through gears can cause deformation in the
gear shaft, leading to gear slippage. In contrast, a cable-driven
mechanism offers a more compact design while ensuring stable
torque transmission.
Traditional cable-driven systems typically provide unidi-
rectional force transmission on the tension side, relying on
a spring to generate force in the opposite direction. How-
While using two servos per finger could resolve this issue, it
would significantly increase the gloves weight and cost.

Fig. 6: Pulley system of the cable-driven mechanism.
To address these challenges, DOGlove utilizes a pulley
system to provide the bi-directional force feedback, as shown
in Fig. 6. DOGlove uses a 0.6 mm stainless steel braided wire
as the cable, chosen for its strength and durability. The Servo
Pulley connects the servo to the finger linkage (Finger Middle)
via the Finger Pulley, maintaining a 1:1 transmission ratio.
To minimize friction during transmission, the Fixed Pulley is
used to redirect the cables path. When the Servo Pulley rotates
Pulley to rotate clockwise. The extra slack on the Cable A side
is taken up by the Servo Pulley A. Since the finger linkage is
fixed to the Finger Pulley, it also rotates clockwise, resulting in
the extension movement of the MCPB joint. Similarly, when
the Servo Pulley rotates counterclockwise, the tension shifts to
Cable A, producing a flexion movement of the MCPB joint.
This configuration enables bi-directional torque transmis-
sion with a simple, compact, and cost-effective design.
3) Fingertip Haptic Feedback:
Haptic feedback refers to the feedback of tactile or kines-
thetic properties. To further enhance the operators tactile
tactile actuator.
Traditional
actuators
eccentric
rotating
mass (ERM) motors and linear resonate actuators (LRAs).
Limited by the inertia of the rotating mass, ERM motors
are slow to start and stop, making it challenging to produce
complex waveforms needed for subtle tactile sensations. On
the contrary, LRAs offer linear motion, resulting in a cleaner
and more precise tactile output.
In DOGlove, we use LRAs with a diameter of 8 mm and
a height of 2.5 mm, installed close to the fingertips. These
LRAs provide vibration stimuli by resonating at approximately
240 Hz along Z axis, which is orthogonal to the fingertip
surface. Operating at 1.2 Vrms, the LRAs generate high-
quality haptic waveforms. To fully leverage the potential of
the LRA, we employ the TI DRV2605L motor driver, which
includes the licensed Immersion TouchSense 2200
haptic library. This driver supports over 100 pre-programmed
haptic feedback.
C. Wrist Localization
In DOGlove, we design a shell with a 14 inch screw con-
nector to accommodate external wrist localization devices. For
our experiments, we use the HTC Vive Tracker for real-
time wrist position tracking. However, the design is compatible
with other solutions, depending on the users requirement.
V. RETARGETING
A. Action Retargeting
To map human hand gestures to a robotic hand, it is essential
to perform action retargeting, which converts motion data
from the glove into robotic hand movements. This process
addresses both the embodiment gap and motion discrepancies.
Previous studies [42, 11, 38] highlight the significance of
interactions. Building on this insight, we apply the 5-DoF
hapticforce feedback to the human operators fingertips and
adopt a retargeting method focused on fingertip positions.
Our approach combines Forward Kinematics (FK)
fingertip
positions
Kinematics (IK) to calculate the corresponding robotic
hand positions. When wearing DOGlove, the human operator
secures their fingertips inside the finger caps. Since the glove
acts as a rigid body, the relative positions of the fingertips with
respect to the gloves origin can be accurately calculated. With
DOGloves anthropomorphic kinematic design and precise
MoCap capabilities, fingertip positions are effortlessly deter-
mined using the gloves built-in FK. To map these positions
to a robotic hand, we utilize Mink , a differential inverse
kinematics library, to generate smooth and feasible motions
for the robotic hand.
A size discrepancy often exists between the human hand and
the target robotic hand. To address this, we introduce a scaling
factor when calculating IK, allowing adaptation to different
robotic hand sizes. This ensures an intuitive teleoperation
experience where the robotic hand naturally mirrors the human
hands gestures. For instance, when the human operator opens
their hand, the robotic hand open proportionally. Similarly,
when the human operator brings their thumb and index finger
This ability for precise fingertip alignment is critical for tasks
like grasping small objects.
In our experiments, we deploy the system on the LEAP
hand  in real-world scenarios and test it with various
robotic hands in the MuJoCo simulator. Fig. 7 presents the
retargeting results of DOGlove in both simulation and real-
world environments.

B. HapticForce Retargeting
To provide the hapticforce feedback, it is first necessary
to sense tactile or force information at the robotic hands
fingertips. This can be achieved using a simple tactile sensor,
such as the force sensing resistor (FSR) sensor [10, 17], or
for better performance, by utilizing an FT sensor [18, 5] or a
vision-based tactile sensor [47, 19].
In our experimental setup, we install a 1-D force
sensor on each fingertip of the LEAP Hand, with a mea-
surement range of 3 kg and a precision of 1 g. During our
quantitative experiments (Section VI), we identify a com-
bination strategy for integrating haptic and force feedback
that optimizes performance. This strategy along with the
corresponding thresholds and feedback patterns is summarized
in Table I. These three thresholds are set with values chosen
based on optimal performance observed across all test trials.
Force Sensor Readings (g)
Haptic Feedback
Force Feedback
Table I: The combination strategy for hapticforce feedback in DOGlove.
The first threshold (10g): This threshold is used to dis-
tinguish actual contact forces from sensor noise. An incorrect
setting of this threshold would either introduce noise or lose
meaningful force information, both of which can reduce the
success rate.
The second threshold (50g): This threshold determines
when to introduce force feedback. During a user study wo
visual input (Section VI-A), we observe that human operators
are highly sensitive to force feedback. To create a more
realistic experience, force feedback is applied only after the
force sensor readings exceed 50 g, which serves as the second
threshold. A lower value would lead to premature activation,
interfering with the human operators perception and typically
lowering the success rate. Conversely, a higher value increases
reliance on haptic feedback, making success dependent on its
performance.
The third threshold (100g): This threshold is used to
stop haptic feedback. Observations from the bottle-slipping
experiment (Section VI-B) reveal that continuous haptic feed-
back during teleoperation can create a misleading sensation,
interfering with the operators ability to perceive the subtle
properties of the objects surface. To address this, a third
threshold is set at 100 g. A lower value shifts reliance toward
force feedback, while a higher value creates more overlap
between simultaneous haptic and force feedback. This overlap
can interfere with human perception and usually results in a
lower success rate.

force readings from the LEAP Hand fingertips are clamped
to the range [0g, 3000g], and mapped linearly to the KP
gain of the Dynamixel servos. For haptic feedback, we use
waveform ID 56 from the haptic engine library, corre-
sponding to Pulsing Sharp 1-100.
This combination strategy for hapticforce retargeting en-
ables human operators to distinguish object shape, size and
softness without visual input. It also improves performance in
provided in Section VI.
VI. EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we use DOGlove to teleoperate the LEAP
Hand  mounted on the Franka Robot Arm to evaluate
its effectiveness through a series of challenging tasks across
three key aspects:
HapticForce Perception: Without visual input, how effec-
tively can DOGlove assist human operators in perceiving
object properties through hapticforce feedback?
Teleoperation Efficiency: Does integrating haptic force
feedback improve vision-based teleoperation success rates
and reduce task completion time? Can DOGlove enable
human operators to perform challenging, contact-rich ma-
nipulation tasks?
IL Compatibility: Can the data collected via DOGlove be
leveraged to train IL policies for dexterous manipulation?
Evaluation Setup: To evaluate the effectiveness of haptic
force perception, we conduct a user study (Section VI-A) and
a quantitative experiment (Section VI-B). Teleoperation effi-
ciency is assessed in Experiment VI-C, while IL compatibility
is evaluated in Experiment VI-D.

depending on the specific task setup:

between five pairs of objects solely through feedback from
wearing an eyemask and headphones). In each trial, a pair of
objects is randomly selected, and users provide their answers

and softness.

distinctly different shapes (Fig. 8b).

Pair 3: Basic Pair, similar softness, different size. The
two toys have similar softness and shapes but vary in

Pair 4: Challenging Pair, similar size and shape, different

water (soft) and the other filled with carbonated cola, shaken
to increase its hardness (Fig. 8e).

pairs 1-3. For challenging pair 4, most participants can per-
ceive softness using only force feedback. Some also discern
softness using only haptic feedback by evaluating the duration
of contact during deformation.
For challenge pair 5, when the robotic hand grasps the
softer toy cabbage, it deforms to resemble the size of the real
cabbage. This deformation increases its perceived softness,
making it difficult for participants to distinguish using force
feedback alone.
For both challenge pairs, combining haptic and force feed-
back slightly reduces user sensitivity, leading to a marginally
lower accuracy.
B. Bottle-Slipping
In both experimental setups, the human operator is required
to perform a bottle-slipping action. Since the LEAP Hand
is not equipped with shear sensors, slipping information is
not directly transmitted to DOGlove. Instead, we infer slip
indirectly through the relationship between friction and the
applied normal force. A larger normal force increases the
friction between the LEAP Hand and the bottle, resulting in
a lower slipping velocity. In our experiments, we measure the
slipping distance and task success rate (determined by whether
the bottle falls) as indicators of the users ability to regulate
normal force effectively.

icantly improves the success rate of this task. Additionally,
incorporating haptic feedback further enhances overall perfor-
mance. However, since the fingers of the LEAP Hand maintain
continuous contact with the bottle during the task, haptic
feedback does not provide additional information beyond using
the glove solely as a MoCap device, resulting in the same
success rate for both conditions.
Due to differences in retargeting strategies, even small
changes in human finger positions can significantly affect
LEAP Hand movements. As a result, AnyTeleop  struggles
to perform the slipping task effectively.
2) Teleoperation with Visual Input
allows operators visual input. To further evaluate the operators
control ability, they are required to slip the bottle to a specified
distance (9 cm). A trial is successful if the bottle slips without
falling. Additionally, We measure the deviation between the
actual slipping distance and the target distance (9 cm).
Success Rate: A trial is denoted as successful if the bottle

causes the bottle to fall and results in failure, a conservative
approach leads to an unsatisfactory distance deviation.

operators are instructed to control the LEAP Hand carefully
and optimally. As shown in Fig. 9a, similar to previous results,
hapticfeedback does not provide additional information and
may even interfere with task precision. However, force feed-
back enables operators to minimize slipping deviation more
effectively. While using DOGlove solely as a MoCap device
achieves the same success rate as with hapticforce feedback,
it results in a larger average slipping deviation.
C. Rotating and Placing the Carton
Fig. 9b, the operator must first pick up the carton horizon-
vertically before placing it into a small bucket.
Success Rate: A trial is denoted as successful if the carton
rotates more than 45 degrees and is successfully placed into
the bucket.
Completion Time: The total time taken to complete the
entire process.
Precise Manipulation: The operator must accurately teleop-
erate to rotate the carton while preventing it from falling.
Visual Obstacle: Grasping the carton is hindered by visual
between the robotic hands fingers and the carton.
