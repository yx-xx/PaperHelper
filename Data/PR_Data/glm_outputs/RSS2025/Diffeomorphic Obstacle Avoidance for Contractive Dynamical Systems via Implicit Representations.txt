the SDF is computed for each point in the point cloud, and the
minimum distance to the obstacle is computed. The SDF is then
computed for each point in the point cloud, and the minimum
distance to the obstacle is computed. The SDF is then
computed for each point in the following way: The SDF is then
computed for each point in the point cloud, and the minimum
distance to the final point in the point cloud is computed. The SDF is then
computed for each point in the point cloud, and the minimum
distance to the obstacle is computed. The S}{{
