Yanhao Yang, Ross L. Hatton
AbstractThis paper presents a gait optimization and motion
planning framework for a class of locomoting systems with mixed
kinematic and dynamic properties. Using Lagrangian reduction
and differential geometry, we derive a general dynamic model
that incorporates second-order dynamics and nonholonomic
robots with nonholonomic constraints as well as swimming robots
with nonisotropic fluid-added inertia and hydrodynamic drag.
Building on Lie group integrators and group symmetries, we
develop a variational gait optimization method for kinodynamic
systems. By integrating multiple gaits and their transitions, we
construct comprehensive motion plans that enable a wide range
of motions for these systems. We evaluate our framework on three
representative examples: roller racer, snakeboard, and swim-
mer. Simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate diverse
of the proposed method and its potential for generalization to
other biological and robotic locomoting systems.
I. INTRODUCTION
Animals use a diverse set of gaitssuch as horses trot-
ting and galloping, snakes slithering and sidewinding, and
body-caudal fin swimming in fishto locomote effectively in
various environments. By switching or transitioning between
different gaits, animals demonstrate remarkable efficiency and
In both biology and robotics, significant research has been
conducted on various forms of locomotion. Beyond systems
whose dynamics are either fully determined by nonholonomic
constraints or solely governed by conservation of momentum
, there exist classes of locomoting systems that exhibit
both kinematic and dynamic effects. These systems, referred
to in this paper as kinodynamic systems, have garnered consid-
erable attention due to their time-varying nonlinear dynamics
and high degree of underactuation.
A representative example of kinodynamic systems is aquatic
animals swimming at intermediate Reynolds numbers. The
swimming of these aquatic animals is modeled as a system
with drift (the ability to glide) due to the mixed inertial
and fluid drag effects [39, 31]. This system is distinct from
swimming at very high or low Reynolds numbers, where the
dynamics are respectively dominated by conservation of mo-
mentum [27, 23] or quasistatic drag equilibrium [39, 64, 51],
both of which produce driftless (or kinematic) locomotion

Execution of the comprehensive motion plan computed using the
proposed method on the roller racer robot. The green curve depicts the
robots position trajectory, and the composite figure illustrates the robots
configuration at different times. The roller racer has only one actuated degree
of freedom: the steering angle between the front and rear wheels, with all
wheels being passive and driven by anti-slip constraints and steering angle
changes. The motion plan incorporates multiple gaits and transitions, enabling
the robot to: a) start from rest and nominal shape into the gait cycle, b)
accelerate to the optimal steady-state motion, c) smoothly switch to the steady-
state gait that maintains maximum speed, d) execute a turn with minimal
energy loss and return to steady-state motion, and e) end the gait cycle
and return to the nominal shape. Throughout the execution, the motion plan
maintains the desired heading angle and meets the average power consumption
constraints.

analysis to kinodynamic swimming locomotion to approximate
the average motion over a gait cycle, enabling the design
of sinusoidal gaits and image-based feedback control .

added mass, lift, and drag forces, deriving oscillatory control
strategies through controllability analysis . Other works

sleigh and its variants, have been studied for their control and
motion planning [30, 20, 32].
combination of nonholonomic constraints and nonholonomic
momentum evolution. The snakeboard [48, 46] and roller
racer [36, 22] are two representative examples. These systems
have inspired extensive research on kinodynamic locomotion,
including controllability analysis and gait design using sinu-
soidal waves [42, 47, 36], gait selection via optimal control
inversion problem [12, 11]. Other studies have explored gait
design using area rules , analytical solutions for trajectory
tracking [54, 18], and the integration of kinodynamic systems
with bipedal riders . Additionally, efforts have been made
to enhance the fidelity of kinodynamic models based on
the snakeboard and roller racer. For instance, some studies
incorporate dissipative forces or viscous friction [29, 46, 36],
account for skidding effects , or introduce improved fric-
tion modeling [49, 53]. Variants of these systems have also
been studied, with research focusing on their modeling and
control [15, 56].
Given that the positions of kinodynamic systems relative
to the world are described by elements of Lie groups, nu-
merical methods that exploit this group structure and pre-
serve its symmetries offer significant advantages in terms of
accuracy and efficiency [38, 21, 13]. These methods have
demonstrated superior performance across various domains,
including simulation [25, 10], control [34, 62], and estimation
[3, 4]. Moreover, variational integrators and discretization
techniques that preserve group structures can be combined
with optimal control to enhance both accuracy and stability
[37, 6, 35, 24, 52]. This idea has been applied to a variety
of robotic systems, including ground vehicles , quadrotors
, and legged robots [58, 17]. These advancements highlight
the potential of Lie group integrators as a powerful tool for
gait optimization in kinodynamic systems.
A common baseline for gait optimization is to use standard
optimal control techniquessuch as direct collocation  or
indirect methods without exploiting Lie group theory.
in which quadrature-based integral approximations may violate
dynamic constraints and accumulate errors, allowing the opti-
mizer to cheat in highly nonlinear systems. While indirect
methods offer better forward rollout accuracy, their backward
pass is more complex and they struggle to incorporate addi-
tional state or input constraints. In contrast, gait optimization
methods that leverage Lie group theory enable full-fidelity
simulations and allow for the direct imposition of constraints
on both control inputs and trajectories, with gradients obtained
via the chain rule.
One line of related work uses Lie group theory for geometric
gait optimization via constraint curvature and the generalized
Stokes theorem [51, 23], but these methods mainly apply
to principally kinematic systems. Geometric insights into the
dynamic phase in kinodynamic systems have been developed
to better understand their structure, though the approach relies
on trial-and-error selection of gaits that couple the geometric
and dynamic phases . Furthermore, other studies employ-
ing Lie group theory or integrators for motion planning in
kinodynamic systems have predominantly focused on way-
point tracking or trajectory optimization [37, 6, 35, 24, 52].
These methods can suffer from discretization errors over long
trajectories and require recalculation for each new waypoint or
trajectory. In contrast, this work focuses on gait optimization
to avoid long trajectory discretization and to generate reusable
motion primitives that enable comprehensive motion planning.
The main contribution of this paper is a gait optimization
and motion planning framework for kinodynamic systems.
This framework comprises:
A general kinodynamic model incorporating kinematic
and dynamics effects, based on Lagrangian reduction
and differential geometry, applicable to a broad range
of kinodynamic systems, including wheeled robots with
nonholonomic constraints and swimming robots with
anisotropic fluid-added inertia and hydrodynamic drag.
A variational gait optimization method for kinodynamic
metries.
A methodology for constructing comprehensive motion
plans that integrate multiple gaits and their transitions,
enabling diverse motion capabilities for kinodynamic
systems.
We evaluate our approach on three representative systems: the
roller racer, the snakeboard, and a swimmer at an intermediate
Reynolds number. All systems are evaluated in simulation, and
the roller racer is additionally tested in hardware experiments.
These evaluations demonstrate the ability of our framework
to achieve a wide range of motions, including acceleration,
steady-state maintenance, gait transitions, and turning, as
shown in Fig. 1 that illustrates the experiment conducted on
the roller racer robot. The results underscore the effectiveness
of the proposed approach and its potential for generalization
to other biological and robotic locomotion systems.
II. KINODYNAMIC SYSTEM MODELING
Kinodynamic systems are characterized by the interplay of
kinematic and dynamic effects. Kinematic effects include the
relationship between inertia, velocity, and momentum, as well
as nonholonomic constraints. Based on the kinematics, one
can derive the reconstruction equation that relates the systems
body velocity to its shape velocity and nonholonomic mo-
mentum. Dynamic effects are governed by the Euler-Lagrange
constrained forces. Through the application of Lagrangian
momentum evolution equations .

DOFs for position, describing its pose in the world, and one DOF for shape (the heading angle between the two carts). The system includes two nonholonomic
viscous friction occurs in the driving direction of each wheelset. Similarly, the snakeboard has five DOFs: three DOFs for position and two DOFs for shape.
The shape is defined by the rotor angle and the cart angle, with the assumption that the two carts rotate together in opposite directions. The two nonholonomic
acts in the driving direction of each wheelset. Finally, the intermediate Reynolds number swimmer has five DOFs: three DOFs for position and two DOFs for
to the three DOFs for position. Instead, fluid dynamics manifest as anisotropic fluid-added mass and hydrodynamic drag acting on each link.
A. Reconstruction Equation
For a general locomoting system, the Lagrangian, L, is
defined as
L(r, r, g, g)  KE(r, r, g) PE(r)
KE(r, r, g)
where KE and PE represent the kinetic and potential energy,
respectively.1 The terms r and r correspond to the systems
shape and shape velocity, while g and g denote the systems
position in SE(2) and its body velocity in se(2), respectively.2
M represents the inertia matrix, with the subscripts repre-
senting the entries corresponding to the coordinates. gi and
1For simplicity, this paper focuses on changes in kinetic energy during
on gravity being counteracted by the ground reaction force in wheeled
robots or by neutral buoyancy in swimmers. However, the proposed approach
is generalizable to systems with variable potential energy, such as those
influenced by gravity or joint stiffness.
2The open circle notation we use here is similar to the dot nota-
derivatives with respect to right-group actions (locally with respect to the
current configuration) rather than coordinate values, producing left-invariant
representations of velocity and force. The open circle superscripts represent
tangent vectors, such as velocity, and the subscripts are for covectors such
as force or momentum. By convention, velocity is represented as the time
derivative of the configuration, and momentum and force are given their own
symbols.

component of the system in its body frame.
Based on the Lagrangian, we can define the body momen-

by a linear operator  which maps permitted combinations of

For example, the full reading of the notation of the body velocity g is the
velocity constructed by taking the derivative of position with respect to right
group actions, and the full reading of the notation of body force
f is the
force constructed by taking the derivative of dissipated energy with respect
to right (body) velocities.
3Momentum is a covector, so we represent it as a row vector here.
If no nonholonomic constraints exist in the system, we can
simply skip this step and define   and  Id.
By the definition of nonholonomic momentum and nonholo-
nomic constraints, we can derive the system kinematics, which
relates the systems body and shape velocities to the current
nonholonomic momentum and nonholonomic constraints:
In this paper, we assume direct control of the system shape,
meaning that unit vectors corresponding to shape control lie in
the kernel of the nonholonomic constraint map. Consequently,
the total nonholonomic momentum can be decomposed into
the coupled nonholonomic momentum, p,4 and the shape
By substituting the decomposition, the kinematics is rear-
ranged into the reconstruction equation, which expresses the
systems body velocity as a function of the current nonholo-
nomic momentum and the shape velocity control:
A(r) r  (r)p,
where A is commonly referred to as the systems local

incorporating dynamic effects.
Note that systems with sufficiently many nonholonomic
constraints to fully determine the body velocity from the
controlled shape will have no nonholonomic momentum, i.e.,
g  A(r) r
p is not defined.
momentum conservation, starting from rest, will take the form:
g  A(r) r
In these two cases, the system reduces to a principally kine-
matic system and a purely mechanical system, respectively
. Extensions to purely mechanical systems starting from
nonzero momentum are discussed in .
4For simplicity, we refer to it as nonholonomic momentum in the rest of
this paper.
B. Momentum Evolution
The momentum evolution can be derived from constrained

nomic constraints, ad-
g pg denotes the rate of change of
a constant momentum expressed in a moving body frame
relative to a fixed observer in space, and
f is the body
force acting on the systems body frame. This body force
includes viscous friction on the wheels of the roller racer
and snakeboard, as well as nonlinear fluid drag forces on the
swimmer at intermediate Reynolds numbers, as considered in
this paper.5 The viscous friction is modeled as being linear
in the wheel velocity, whereas the fluid drag force increases
quadratically with the flow velocity:

The time derivative of the nonholonomic momentum can be
computed by differentiating its definition:

acceleration of the shape into (10) allows for the calculation
of the joint actuator torque .

rotation operation that expresses velocities or forcesmomenta in body-aligned
coordinates.
C. Examples
The key features of the three examples of kinodynamic
systems considered in this paper are summarized in Fig. 2.
Both the roller racer and the snakeboard are kinodynamic
systems with one degree of freedom (DOF) of nonholonomic
namic effects caused by internal relative motion between
multiple bodies. For these systems, wheel friction is modeled
as linear viscous friction [46, 36].
The primary difference between the roller racer and the
snakeboard lies in their actuation. The roller racer has a
single actuated DOFthe steering anglewhere the inertia
rearrangement and constraint directions are coupled to the
steering control. In contrast, the snakeboard features two
actuated DOFs: one for the rotor and the other for the
trucks steering (with the trucks assumed to steer together in
opposite directions). This configuration decouples the inertia
rearrangement from the constraint directions.
Unlike the roller racer and the snakeboard, the swimmer
at intermediate Reynolds numbers does not involve direct
nonholonomic constraints. Instead, its dynamics are modeled
by Morisons equation, incorporating anisotropic fluid-added
mass and hydrodynamic drag forces acting on each body
[9, 8, 50]. Consequently, the swimmer possesses three DOFs
of nonholonomic momentum, corresponding to the position
dimensions. In this case, the kinematic and dynamic effects are
strongly coupled, with the fluid-added mass and drag forces
being shape-dependent and directly acting on the joints.
III. VARIATIONAL GAIT OPTIMIZATION BASED ON LIE
GROUP INTEGRATOR
In this section, we introduce the variational gait optimization
method for kinodynamic systems. The Lie group integrator
provides an efficient and accurate method to compute the
gradients and Jacobians of the gait-induced displacement with
respect to the gait parameters, enabling effective variational
gait optimization. We begin by defining the displacement, non-
holonomic momentum, and power consumption corresponding
to a gait cycle. These terms are fundamental concepts in the
gait optimization problem, as most objective and constraint
functions rely on them. Once the gradients of these terms are
of the optimization objective and constraint functions, thereby
achieving variational gait optimization.
Without loss of generality, consider a gait  in the shape
ment induced by this gait is given by
Id  g(t)dt
where T represents the gait period, and P is the product
integral. This formulation essentially is a Lie group integrator.

summing the gradient contributions from the control change at each segment
along the trajectory. The contribution of each segment is depicted as the
dashed trajectory. Due to group symmetries, a control change at any segment
does not affect the shape of the remaining trajectory, similar to rotating the
joints of a robotic arm.

differential equation for momentum evolution:

where p(0) is the initial nonholonomic momentum at the start
of the gait execution.
defined as the integral of the squared actuator torque (t)2
over the gait period:
A. Gradient of Gait-Induced Displacement
By differentiating the Lie group integral with respect to the
gait parameters , we obtain
g-1(t)gdt
The second term in the sum inside the parentheses arises
because the period T is treated as a function of the gait
during differentiation.
Using the reconstruction equation in (7b), the derivative of
the systems body velocity can be expressed as
where time-varying variables [](t) are denoted as []t for
clarity in the equations. Because the gait in the shape space is
parameterized by , the derivatives of the shape position and
velocity can be directly obtained from the parameterization
function. In contrast, the derivative of the momentum is more
will be addressed in the next section.
B. Gradient of Nonholonomic Momentum
Based on the nonholonomic momentum solution in (15),
the chain rule can be applied to compute the derivative of the
nonholonomic momentum:
p(t) p(0)
[] for clarity in the equations. The last term arises because
the period T depends on the gait parameters , requiring
consideration of the integration bounds during differentiation.
for executing the gait can be derived in the same manner, as
it follows a similar sum-integral structure.
A key difference between the gradient of momentum and
that of displacement or energy consumption is the temporal
autocorrelation of momentum. Specifically, the momentum at
time t depends on the time series of momentum preceding
pendence transforms the gradient computation into solving a
linear system after discretization. Consequently, this distinc-
tion affects the computational accuracy of the gradients post-
C. Invariance and Gradient Error Analysis
For principally kinematic and purely mechanical systems
described by (8) and (9), which do not involve nonholonomic
variant. Specifically, as illustrated in Fig. 3, the body velocities
are trajectory-independent, meaning any variation in the body
velocity at a point on the trajectory applies only a left group
action to the subsequent trajectory. Integrating this variation
along the trajectory, as in (17b), yields the corresponding
variation in the final displacement. Consequently, once the
trajectory is simulated, the displacement gradient along it can
be directly computed, with accuracy linearly proportional to
the discretization density. These characteristics allow for an
efficient and accurate gradient-based variational gait optimiza-
tion across a wide range of principally kinematic and purely
mechanical systems.
In contrast, for the kinodynamic systems considered in this
invariance. The momentum evolution is a self-dependent ordi-
nary differential equation, causing momentum gradient errors
to scale quadratically with discretization density. Because the
displacement gradient depends on the momentum gradient,
these errors propagate into the displacement gradient as well.
In this case, optimizing gaits or trajectories over long horizons
becomes impractical, because discretization errors or model
mismatches accumulate. Instead, we focus on optimizing pe-
riodic gaits and short-term transitions between them. These
motion primitives are subsequently combined to construct
complete motion plans, as detailed in the motion planning
section below.
IV. GEOMETRIC MOTION PLANNING
Motion planning for kinodynamic systems is inherently
more complex than for principally kinematic or purely me-
chanical systems due to their time-dependent dynamics. In
kinematic systems, where dynamics are quasi-static, motion
planning can often be achieved using simple gaits to locomote
directly in the desired direction. However, in kinodynamic
accounting for the evolution of momentum, adding additional
complexity to the planning process. Efficient locomotion in-
volves first accumulating momentum and then directing it to
drive towards the desired direction. This principle appears in
many real-world examples, such as roller racer or snakeboard
riders swinging to accelerate before steering towards their
towards the desired direction using their streamlined bodies.
In this paper, we leverage the gradient computations based on
the Lie group integrator discussed earlier to identify gaits and
plans for kinodynamic systems.
We begin by considering the following optimization prob-
horizon T, significantly longer than a single gait period T
(i.e., TT), subject to joint position limits and energy
consumption constraints:
g[x,y](T)
where g[x,y](T) denotes the linear displacement over the
horizon T, R represents the range of motion of the robot
c defines the power consumption limit. Due to en-
ergy dissipation from velocity-dependent friction or fluid drag,
as well as constraints on energy consumption and the range
of motion of the joints, the robot will eventually converge to
a steady state with periodic motion and state. This allows us
to decompose the original problem into four sub-problems,
solving for multiple gaits and their transitions to construct a
comprehensive motion plan, as illustrated in Fig. 4:
1) Steady-state gait optimization: Finding the optimal gait
S and periodic nonholonomic momentum state pS that
maximize the steady-state speed.
2) Acceleration gait optimization: Identifying the accelera-
tion gait A that optimally accelerates the robot to the
steady state.
3) Transition gait optimization: Determining the transition
gaits TS for:
a) Starting from rest at the nominal shape and transi-
tioning to the acceleration gait,
b) Transitioning from the acceleration gait to the
steady-state gait,
c) Returning from the steady-state gait to the nominal
4) Turning gait optimization: Finding the turning gait T
to redirect the steady-state robot to a new direction.
A. Steady-State Gait Optimization
We first address steady-state gait optimization, which in-
volves maintaining periodic motion and state while maxi-
mizing velocity and satisfying specific constraints. This gait
optimization can be formulated as:
pS(0)  pS(TS)
rS(t) R,
t [0, TS]
In this formulation, the objective function seeks to maximize
the average translational velocity of the gait. Constraint (21b)
ensures that the nonholonomic momentum pS is periodic
throughout the gait cycle. Constraint (21c) requires the robot
to maintain its orientation before and after the gait cycle. Con-
straint (21d) enforces that joint positions remain within their
prescribed limits. Constraint (21e) requires that the average
energy consumption stays within the allowable range. Finally,
(21f) serves as an auxiliary feasibility condition, ensuring that
the steady state can be reached from rest via an acceleration
gait while adhering to the power consumption constraint. This
avoids potential energy barriers that could render the steady
state inaccessible. Details on this auxiliary feasibility problem,
as well as the design of the acceleration gait, will be discussed
in the next section.
B. Acceleration Gait Optimization
Due to the time-varying dynamics of kinodynamic systems,
naively executing the steady-state gait for acceleration is
state in this section.
Illustration of the optimal gaits and transitions for the roller racer
(top) and their demonstration on the robot (middle: acceleration-transition-
steady-state gait; bottom: steady-state-left-turn-steady-state and steady-state-
right-turn-steady-state gaits). In the demonstration, the dashed line represents
the robots position trajectory, with its color indicating the corresponding gait
being executed at each point.
We begin by introducing the feasibility problem formulated
in (21f). The objective is to find an acceleration gait that
accelerates the system from rest to a steady state, achieving
the average kinetic energy level similar to that of the optimal
steady-state gait without violating joint or power constraints:
pF(0)  pF(TF)
rF(t) R,
t [0, TF]
KEF > KES,
where EF,0 represents the power consumption during the first
gait cycle starting from rest (i.e., zero nonholonomic momen-
tum),7 and KES and KEF denote the average kinetic energy
of the steady-state gait and that of the feasible acceleration
gait in its steady state, respectively. This feasibility problem
ensures that an acceleration gait exists to bring the system from
rest to the kinetic energy level of the steady-state gait while
respecting all constraints, thereby enabling a further transition
to the steady-state gait. In the steady-state gait optimization,
this feasibility problem is solved as an auxiliary problem
alongside to ensure the feasibility of the steady-state gait.
For the actual acceleration gait optimization, simply ensur-
ing the existence of feasible gaits is insufficient, because we
also want to maximize efficiency and maintain the heading
angle. To this end, we propose an approach for optimizing
acceleration gaits. A key characteristic of the acceleration
behavior in the kinodynamic systems studied in this paper is
g[x,y], converges to the steady-state velocity, g[x,y]
, in a manner
analogous to a linear mass-damper system:
g[x,y](t) (1 ekt)g[x,y]
where k represents the convergence rate or equivalent damping
coefficient. This behavior emerges naturally from the dynamic
energy to the system, while energy dissipation due to viscous
friction is proportional to velocity.
For systems like the roller racer and snakeboard, which
assume linear viscous friction, this analogy is particularly
through continuous rolling. For intermediate Reynolds number
dependent and the fluid drag quadratically velocity-dependent,
they are anisotropic and shape-dependent. Consequently, an
efficient acceleration gait minimizes the equivalent total fluid
drag during acceleration. Thus, the linear mass-damper model
remains a valid approximation for these systems, as illustrated
in the following figure.
Using the linear mass-damper approximation model for the
acceleration period, we can reformulate the feasibility problem
nonholonomic momentum, which implies that enforcing constraints only at
zero momentum and steady-state momentum does not guarantee compliance
with the power limit at intermediate points. However, for the kinodynamic
systems studied in this paper, the power consumption peak typically occurs
either at the start or in the steady state. In practice, one can validate the
power consumption limits after optimizing the gait. Addressing the power
consumption constraints more rigorously during acceleration remains an open
as an acceleration gait optimization problem:
pA(0)  pA(TA)
rA(t) R,
t [0, TA]
KEA > KES,
where the subscript []R denotes the total transient period,
which we define as the rise time required to reach 90 of
the steady-state velocity, calculated based on the linear mass-
damper model. The objective function seeks to determine
the optimal acceleration gait that minimizes the deviation
from the steady-state velocity during the transition. The term
first gait cycle starting from rest. Constraints on this term,
combined with constraints on the orientation difference at the
steady state, ensure a consistent heading angle throughout the
acceleration period.8
C. Transition Gait Optimization
With the optimal gaits derived in the previous section, a
complete motion plan can be constructed by combining these
gaits. The remaining challenge is to enable smooth transitions
between these gaits without loss of generality. In this section,
we propose a method for gait transitions using polynomials.
To ensure a smooth transition while respecting power con-
sumption constraints, we employ a fifth-order polynomial to
connect between the two gaits. This polynomial guarantees
continuity up to the shape acceleration at both ends. Because
the initial and final shape positions, velocities, and accel-
erations are fully determined by the gaits at either end of
the transition, all polynomial coefficients can be computed
directly. The transition gait optimization problem for determin-
ing the transition gait TS(t0, t1, TTS) for transitioning from
8Unlike the non-convex power consumption discussed earlier, the orien-
tation displacement before and after each gait cycle is a linear function of
the momentum change. This relationship arises because the body velocity is
computed by applying the linear mapping  to the momentum, as shown
in (7b). Because  is shape-dependent and the shape remains consistent
across each cycle for shape-controlled gaits, the orientation change produced
during each gait cycle is linearly related to the nonholonomic momentum.
and at the steady state, the orientation remains unchanged throughout the
acceleration period.
