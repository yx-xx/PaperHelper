AbstractLocomotion is a fundamental skill for humanoid
robots. However, most existing works make locomotion a single,
the kinematic capabilities of humanoid robots. In contrast, humans
possess versatile athletic abilitiesrunning, jumping, hopping,
and finely adjusting gait parameters such as frequency and
foot height. In this paper, we investigate solutions to bring
such versatility into humanoid locomotion and thereby propose
for versatile locomotion. By designing a general command space in
the aspect of tasks and behaviors, along with advanced techniques
like symmetrical loss and intervention training for learning a
whole-body humanoid controlling policy in simulation, HUGWBC
enables real-world humanoid robots to produce various natural
customizable parameters such as frequency, foot swing height,
further combined with different body height, waist rotation,
and body pitch. Beyond locomotion, HUGWBC also supports
real-time interventions from external upper-body controllers like
any locomotive behavior. Extensive experiments validate the high
tracking accuracy and robustness of HUGWBC withwithout

provide an in-depth analysis of how the various commands affect
humanoid movement and offer insights into the relationships
between these commands. To our knowledge, HUGWBC is the
first humanoid whole-body controller that supports such versatile
locomotion behaviors with high robustness and flexibility.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recent progress in humanoid robots has shown impressive
results in achieving complex tasks, and the huge potential
to become a general robot platform [4, 55, 3, 41]. It is
a fundamental skill to support various humanoid motions,
enabling them to navigate environments and perform tasks
with agility and adaptability. However, most current humanoid
locomotion systems, although showing impressive results in
motion-based control [20, 23, 12, 3] and mobile manipula-
controllable gait styles, leading to single, tedious, unextendable,
and unconstrained movements. Consider humans, we have
versatile athletic abilities, such as running, jumping, and even
hopping. Even when only walking, we can fine-tune our

exploring the edge of humanoid robots abilities. To resolve

the challenge and build a unified and general humanoid

HUGWBC is designed for generating versatile locomotion
with dynamic, customizable control, enabling the robot to

behavior parameters foot swing height and gait frequency, and
allows combining posture parameters such as body height,
waist rotation, and body pitch. To achieve this, HUGWBC
includes a general command space designed for humanoid
versatile gaits within one single policy (except the hopping
gait) using reinforcement learning in simulation, which can be
directly transferred onto real robots.
Positioned as a basic controller for humanoid robots to
perform a wider range of tasks in diverse real-world scenarios,
HUGWBC introduces intervention training and supports real-
time external control signals of the upper body, like teleop-
maintaining precise locomotion control. An overview of the
framework is illustrated in Fig. 2.
In experiments, we show HUGWBC preserves high tracking
accuracy on eight different commands under four different gaits;
we also ablate the improvement in stability and robustness of the
upper body intervention training. We further provide a detailed
analysis of how commands combination works, shedding light
on the intricate relationships between these commands and
how they can be leveraged to optimize movement performance.
Through this work, we aim to significantly broaden the scope
of humanoid locomotion capabilities, pushing the boundaries
of what is possible with current robotic systems.
The key contributions are summarized as follows:
An extended general command space with advanced training
techniques designed for versatile humanoid locomotion.
Accurate tracking for eight different commands under four
different gaits, using one policy for 3 of the 4 gaits.
A basic humanoid controller that supports external upper-
body intervention and enables a wider range of loco-
manipulation tasks.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Model-Based Humanoid Controller
Controlling humanoid robots has become one of the most
fascinating problems since decades ago, many researchers and
engineers have built complicated systems and tried to solve
them with model-based methods in a perspective of optimal
control (OC) [47, 49, 1, 11, 51, 34, 40]. These works typically
employ trajectory optimization with dynamic models of varying
levels of complexity, such as the linear inverted pendulum
dynamics model [44, 25, 53], to perform online optimization,
or generate periodic motion control through the hybrid zero
dynamics model [7, 48, 21]. However, most of them can only
generate motion based on predefined contact sequences. Even
some have successfully incorporated online optimization to
generate real-time motion sequences and contact schedules
based on instant environmental feedback and user commands
and run on humanoid robots in the real world , the
nonlinear dynamics and multi-contact optimization of humanoid
systems demand significant computational resources, making
it challenging to meet real-time performance requirements. A
promising solution is to decouple the whole-body multi-contact
optimization control problem into two subproblems: contact
planning and motion optimization [35, 34, 8]. The goal of the
contact planning stage is to generate the desired multi-contact
sequence for rich whole-body motion and gait control, including
the order and position of both hand and foot contacts [39, 25].
The motion optimization phase optimizes the robot motion
trajectory based on the contact sequence. Although decoupling
simplifies the problem, model-based approaches still rely on
several assumptions, including perfect state estimation and
flawless execution of planned movements. However, most
assumptions no longer hold in the real world, and the dynamics
model is not perfect to describe real robot systems, which
results in poor robustness when applied in real environments.
B. Learning-Based Humanoid Controller
Recent advancements in learning-based controllers have
demonstrated the locomotion capability to go through rough
terrains [41, 17], achieving smooth and efficient motions .
predict surrounding terrain through collision detection and
swiftly adapt their motion, presenting significant challenges
for inherently unstable humanoid robotic systems. Some recent
approaches incorporated depth maps or elevation maps into the
policy observations, enabling impressive parkour tasks [56, 28].
Some researchers have utilized chain-contact reward functions
to learn jumping gaits for humanoid robots .
humanoid robots [4, 13] and large-scale humanoid motion
tracking and learned rich whole-body motion representations for
humanoid robots. Some studies focused on upper body tracking
combined with maintaining balance in the lower body . Some
others explored controlling whole-body joints in one policy,
differing primarily in their control interfacescommand spaces:
He et al. tracked whole-body motion capture keypoints; Fu
et al., Ji et al. track retargeted joint position; He et al. tracked
VR-based head and hands keypoints; He et al. tracked all of
these and propose a universal interface approach. Different from
an IK-based upper-body controller with a learning-based lower-
body controller. The lower-body command space includes the
task command and the pose command as used in this work, and
they introduced the prior knowledge of upper-body movements
to the lower-body policy to help its robustness. However, we
show that without such a component, we can still construct a
robust loco-manipulation controller.
We made several choices in this work: 1) we extend the
command space beyond all of these previous works, by
introducing additional behavior commands that control the
foot and the gait; 2) we employ a learning-based controller to
control whole-body joints (instead of only lower-body as in
Lu et al.) while supporting external controller (with IK or joint
sequences) to take over upper-body joints, since upper-body and
lower-body serves as different requirements. Accurate upper-
body control is useful for tasks that require precision, while
the robot should be robust to arbitrary upper-body intervention
under any behavior.
