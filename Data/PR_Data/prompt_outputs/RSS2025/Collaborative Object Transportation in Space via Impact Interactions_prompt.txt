AbstractWe present a planning and control approach for col-
laborative transportation of objects in space by a team of robots.
Object and robots in microgravity environments are not subject
to friction but are instead free floating. This property is key to
how we approach the transportation problem: the passive objects
are controlled by impact interactions with the controlled robots.
In particular, given a high-level Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
specification of the transportation task, we synthesize motion
plans for the robots to maximize the specification satisfaction in
terms of spatial STL robustness. Given that the physical impact
interactions are complex and hard to model precisely, we also
present an alternative formulation maximizing the permissible
uncertainty in a simplified kinematic impact model. We define
the full planning and control stack required to solve the object
transportation problem; an offline planner, an online replanner,
and a low-level model-predictive control scheme for each of the
robots. We show the method in a high-fidelity simulator for a
variety of scenarios and present experimental validation of 2-

I. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of object transportation with autonomous
robots is both a relevant and a much-researched topic. This
problem appears in different settings and solutions take on a
myriad of different forms. In this work, we consider object
transportation in the context of space environments, with
robots such as the Astrobee  in the International Space
construction  or deorbeting debris [12, 3]. While robots
and objects in land, sea, and air environments are subject to
friction and gravity, robots and objects in space do not locally
suffer from this. When collaborative transportation takes place,
this absence should be utilized to its fullest extent.
We propose a planning and control approach for collab-
orative transportation of free-floating objects where impacts
are the only robot-object interactions and the only way to
change an objects velocity. An example of such scenario
in an experimental platform with freeflyers is illustrated in
Fig. 1. The advantage of transportation via impact interaction
is its modeling and computational simplicity and its scalability
(both computationally and in robot availability). Compared
to grasping and carrying, this approach also promotes lower
energy consumption as well as increased robot availability,
since the impacts are minimal, instantaneous, and occasional.
An experimental platform with two controllable freeflyers and a
passive object. To transport the object from the top of the figure to the bottom
while avoiding the obstacle, Robot 1 impacts it to make it travel towards the
top left corner, where Robot 2 impacts it to travel towards the bottom left
where Robot 2 impacts it to reach its desired final destination. Impact times
are shown as red stars.
to the object (e.g. via a gripper) as these impacts can occur
between objects and robots of any size and shape.
Using the compact formulation of both kinematic impact
equations and forward reachability of undisturbed friction-
less systems, we are able to model this complex problem
as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming problem (MILP),
providing global optimality guarantees even in the presence
of complex spatio-temporal goals and constraints. Although
the kinematic impact equations are compact, having them
be accurate is a challenge. To that end, we propose an
impact-robust planner that explicitly maximizes permissible
uncertainty in the impact equation.
Upon deployment, we consider the interplay between the
offline planner, an online replanner and a model predictive
controller. The offline planner synthesizes a motion plan with
simplified point-impact kinematics while the online replanner
locally adapts the motion plan around a pre-planned impact to
consider updated state information of the approaching object
and the physical shapes of the robot and object. Our planning
and control method is shown in a high-fidelity simulator for
a range of transportation scenarios and on an experimental
freeflyer space platform for 2-robot, 1-object scenarios.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows.
We present an impact-aware planner for multi-agent
systems with spatio-temporal specifications on control-
lable freeflyer robots and passive free-floating objects.
The planner maximizes either model-agnostic robustness
metrics like STL spatial robustness or the uncertainty on
the post-impact state of objects.
We then present an impact-aware online planner that
relaxes simplifying assumptions on the impact kinematics
used in the offline planner and considers updated state
information of the free-floating objects.
We present a model predictive control strategy to execute
the mission in real-time, which we show in a high-fidelity
simulator and on an experimental freeflyer platform.
A. Related Work
There is a significant body of work on collaborative trans-
portation of objects with robots. Examples include multi-robot
formation transport in dynamics scenarios  with parameter
and dynamics uncertainty . A distributed control approach
has also been proposed for formation transportation in space
.  proposes a game-theoretic approach using robots that
apply either force or torque to the transported object. Closest
to our approach on planning is  which considers a reach-

scenarios [18, 21]. We refer to , a comprehensive, albeit
work utilizes simpler impact kinematics, due to our online
replanning strategy, and explicitly utilizes the free-floating
property of objects in space.
Close to our planning and control approach are works on
robot air hockey and billiards, where impacts are explicitly
used in generating desired behavior of passive objects that
float or roll passively. In , a hierarchical learning-based
planner and optimization based controller is utilized to play air
hockey against an unknown opponent.  and  consider

the robots to replan during execution and to collaborate on
achieving a high-level specification.  considers minimal
pokes to place objects in desired location. The presence of
friction makes this problem challenging. We are instead able
to utilize kinematic impact models and forward reachability in
a globally optimal planner.
In the space of spatio-temporal planning and control, our
approach relies on the embedding of STL specifications in
mixed-integer optimization problems . The complexity of
collaborative specifications ensure that conventional trajec-
tory formulations (via constant time discretization) become
intractable. We hence rely on generalizations of these embed-
dings to piecewise-linear curves  for objects and Bezier
curves  for robots.
II. PRELIMINARIES
Let R, N, and B be the set of real, natural (including
zero), and binary numbers respectively. R0 denotes the set
of nonnegative real numbers.
A. System Modelling
The set of robots is denoted by R  {R1, ..., RR} and the
set of passive objects by O  {O1, ..., OO} with S  RO
the set of all systems, which are assumed to be rigid bodies.
Let xS be the state of system S S with xS  [pS, qS, pS, qS]
where p and q indicate position and orientation of the system.
As we wish to plan for specific impact times, let
impact(Si, Sj, t) {, } be an indicator whether Si S
impacts Sj S at time t. Note that impact(Si, Sj, t)
impact(Sj, Si, t).
M(xSi, xSj, t) : Rn  Rn  R0 Rn be an impact model
states of Si and Sj at impact time t and responding with the
post-impact state of Si (its first argument).
B. Signal Temporal Logic
Signal Temporal Logic (STL)  is a formal specifica-
tion language for dynamical systems. An STL formula is
interpreted over real-valued signals qualitatively (the signal
satisfies or violates the formula) or quantitatively (the extent
to which the signal satisfies or violates the formula). Time-
bounded STL over n-dimensional continuous-time signals
Definition 1 (Time-bounded STL). Let I  [t1, t2] be a closed
bounded time interval, where t1, t2 R0, t1 t2. Let  :
X R be a real-valued function and p  (x) 0 a
Boolean predicate. STL formulas are recursively defined as
where  and are the Boolean negation and conjunction
operators and UI is the time-bounded Until operator.
Formula 1UI2 specifies that 1 should hold until, within
defined as I  UI  ( holds eventually, within I), and
I   I  ( holds at all times within I).
Spatial robustness is a quantitative way to evaluate satis-
faction or violation of a formula by considering the degree of
satisfaction via the value of the predicate function :
p(t, x)  (x(t)),
1UI2(t, x)  max
min(2(, x), min
The reader is referred to  for a thorough analysis of spatial
and also temporal robust semantics of STL.

Eq. (5)). The dashed and solid line indicate a trajectory of the object and

The impact occurs after the first Bezier curve. (b) Impact kinematics for non-
rotating cylindrical objects (according to Eq. (6)). The moving blue object
impacts a stationary green object. Both objects direction is changed according
to the tangential and normal component of the impact on the boundaries of
the objects.
C. Zonotopes
A zonotope in Rn is a tuple Z < c, G >, where c Rn
is the center, and G Rnk is a set of its k generators. We
use V (Z) to denote the set of vertices of zonotope Z.
Zonotopes enjoy a range of advantageous properties which
make them excellent candidates for reachability analysis: they
are defined as Minkowski sums of their generators and they are
closed under Minkowski sums and linear transformation .
Z < c, diag([
which defines a hyperrectangle. For trajectory planning, these
hyperrectangles can be embedded for reach and avoid behavior
using integer variables in mixed-integer programming.
D. Impact Kinematics
Let pS(t) and pS(t) denote the position and velocity of a
robot or an object and let p
S (t) and p
S (t) denote the pre-
and post-impact velocity for an impact at time t. The general
impact model is
Si(t)  M( p
Si(t), p
Sj(t), t).
For point masses, impact kinematics can be approximated
by linear relations between pre- and post-impact velocities.
The post-impact velocities can then be obtained via
with its recognizable solution
R  mR emO
R  (1  e)mO
O  (1  e)mR
R  mO emR
with e [0, 1] being the constant of restitution relating the pre-
and post-impact velocities, which is a property of the materials
under impact. We use m1, m2, m3, m4 for short-hand notation
of the mass fractions.
An example of a robot trajectory (solid line) and an object
trajectory (dotted line) of the same mass can be seen in
Fig. 2(a). For e  1 it is a perfectly elastic kinematic impact,
For bodies of a physical size, the pre-impact velocities p
O can be split into a tangent and normal component
under the assumption of non-rotating bodies or no transfer of
rotational momentum during impact. We can then write the
velocity jump as a system of linear equations in the local
where x and y denote the tangent and orthogonal axis w.r.t.
the plane of impact. The post-impact velocities in the global
frame can then be obtained via a rotation with , the angle
between global and local frame,
A schematic example of point-mass and cylindrical body
impacts with its global and local axis is shown in Fig. 2(b).
E. Bezier Curves
Bezier curves are a popular tool in trajectory planning of
autonomous systems [22, 17, 20]. A Bezier curve is repre-
sented by a polynomial equation and parameterized by a finite
number of control points, its decision variables. Namely, a
Bezier curve r of degree d is constructed and evaluated using
the summation of its d Bernstein polynomials multiplied with
their respective d control points according to
(1 s)dbsb  r(b),
where s is the phasing parameter,
(1 s)dbsb is the
bth Bernstein polynomial, and r(b) is the bth control point.
An example of a Bezier curve with its control points is shown
in Fig. 3.(a). Although Bezier curves are nonlinear in nature,

hull (shaded blue), (b) a trajectory of robot Ri with three Bezier curves.

formulation for objects (first degree Bezier curves) and robots (higher-degree

and post-impact curves of impact 1. rR1(1) and rR1(2) are the pre- and
post-impact curves of impact 2.

collision avoidance.

and r(d1), are linear combinations of the control points
of r(s) and the interval hull of r is formed as a linear
combination of its control points. This means that smooth,
kinematically feasible, and collision-free trajectories can be
constructed through Mixed-Integer Linear Programming by
returning a finite set of control points of a Bezier curve as
illustrated in Fig. 3.(b).
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND APPROACH
We wish to solve the problem of collaborative transportation
of passive objects in a weightless environments by a team of
robots. The transportation tasks as well as the goals for the
are specified via STL. The robots interact with the objects via
an instantaneous impact. Formally, let Ri R and Oi O be
controllable robots and uncontrollable objects. We aim to find
a controller uRi, Ri R, such that the robot and the object
trajectories are maximally robust. Furthermore, we require
STL satisfaction, kinematic constraints and smoothness, and
collision avoidance.
A. Problem formulation
We formulate the problem of collaborative transportation
via impact interactions as
J(xR, uR, xO),
s.t. [xR, xO]  ,
xR VR, xO VO,
M(xRi(t), xOj(t))
if impact(Ri, Oj, t)
otherwise
M(xOi(t), xRj(t))
if impact(Oi, Rj, t)
otherwise
pSi(t) pSj(t)2 radSi  radSj,
where xSi  [p, , p, ]T R2n is the state of a system
Si {O, R}, and xR and xO denote the conjoined state of
all robots and objects respectively. VR and VO denote the per-
missible velocity set of the robots and objects respectively and
radSi the bounding radius of Si. uRi Rn denotes the control
input of Ri. We assume workspace constraints and obstacle
avoidance are captured in  (e.g. [t0,tf ](xSi Obs)).
Eq. (9a) ensures that the trajectories of the robots and
objects satisfy the high-level specification. Eq. (9b) are the
velocity constraints. Eq. (9c) and (9d) ensure the conditional
smoothness and kinematics of the robot and object respec-
and an object. Eq. (9e) ensures collision avoidance between
robots and objects, except at moments when impact is desired.
Example 1. Consider a 2-robot, 1-object scenario; R
{R1, R2}, O  {O1}, S  {R1, R2, O1}. We use a corridor
transportation scenario as a running example, as shown in
Fig. 4(a). The robots in the bottom and top of the figure,
both depicted as a black dots, aim to transport the object
depicted with white details to the green square area in the top
before time runs out, corresponding to an STL specification
O1  [t0,tf ](xO1 Xf). Additionally, the robots and the
object should avoid collision with corridor walls, correspond-
ing to STL specification Si  [t0,tf ](xSi Wfree), Si S.
To transport the object from a static initial position to a static
final position, the plan requires at least two impacts; a throw
and a catch.
B. Approach
We take a hierarchical approach to address the problem.
We define an offline planner that, using simplified kinematic
impact models, can efficiently solve the multi-agent planning
problem with STL specifications via a Bezier curve trajectory
formulation. A part of this plan is when and where robots
impact objects. An online replanner that corrects the plans of
the two Bezier curves leading up to and following an impact.
The replanner considers a more complex impact model and
the updated states of the robots and objects during execution.
tracking of the planned Bezier curves and ensures the pre-
impact conditions to enable the desired post-impact behavior
of the robot.
We describe the offline planner in Sec IV with STL spatial
robustness as the optimization function in Sec. IV-B and an
impact-robust optimization metric in Sec. IV-C. In Sec. V
we describe how this planning problem is implemented as a
mixed-integer optimization problem. The online replanner is
detailed in Sec. VI and the impact-aware MPC in Sec. VII.
IV. OFFLINE PLANNER
In the offline planner, we use a simplistic point-mass
kinematic impact model which ensures that all constraints
regarding impacts can be encoded linearly. Additionally, for
between impacts. Instead, we abstract the planning aspect of
Eq. (9) to a kinematically constrained geometric optimization
problem. In summary, we make two additional assumptions:
Assumption 1 (Planner Impact Modeling). For the modeling
of the impact kinematics in the planner, the radii rRi and
rOi of robots Ri R and objects Oi O respectively are
assumed zero, and hence Ri and Oi are considered points.
Assumption 2 (Planner State Modeling). The state xSi is
reduced to xSi  [pSi, pSi] for the planner, meaning we ignore
rotation of the robots and objects.
Relaxing these assumptions in the offline planner would
introducing the nonlinear impact model of Eq. (6) which,
for planning, introduces non-convexities, making it difficult
to obtain global optimal solutions w.r.t. the specifications Si.
Inaccuracies introduced by these assumptions will be treated
by the replanner and the controller.
For the robots, we consider integrator dynamics with uncon-
strained (but attenuated, see Sec. V) acceleration inputs and
the possibility of discrete jumps in velocities due to an impact
with an object. As such, we define the impact model operator
for the offline planner as
Mplanner(xSi, xSj)  mSi emSj
mSi  mSj
Si  (1  e)mSj
mSi  mSj
according to the point-mass impact equations in Eq. (5).
A. Trajectory Formulation
Finding a plan to satisfy Eq. (9) inadvertently includes a
decision on if, when, and with whom to impact according
to Eqs. (9c) (9d) and (9e). Fine-grained constant-time dis-
cretization of the problem would lead to a large number of
possible impact points to be considered; later on in the MILP
formulation of the planner this would project onto a large num-
ber of binary variables. In order to reduce the computational
with Bezier curves. We define a curvature Bezier curve r(s)
and a temporal Bezier curve t : h(s). We then couple these
curves to parameterize the physical trajectory over time. We
base our multi-agent Bezier formulation on the work in
which has been explored for high-level specifications with STL
in . In these works, the authors express a trajectory curve
p via the use of r(s) and h(s) as
r(s) : p(h(s)),
r(s) : p(h(s))h(s),
where p is the physical trajectory of interest, parameterized by
the two types of Bezier curves. The main advantage of this
formulation is that we may generate trajectories spanning long
distances and durations with a small number of Bezier curves
and hence a small number of variables. The computational
speedup in the context of STL was shown in .
For objects, r(s) and h(s) are limited to 1st degree Beziers
(straight line curves) as only impacts with robots may in-
stantaneously change their velocity. An indicative example of
the parametrization, in addition to requirements on collision
avoidance is shown in Fig. 3(c). Note that impacts may
only occur at endpoints of Bezier curves and that an impact
subsequently assigns a pre-impact label to that Bezier curve
and a post-impact label to the proceeding curve.
B. Spatially Robust Offline Planner
We will discuss two different options of integrating the im-
pact kinematics into the planner: without and with uncertainty
in the impact kinematics. This section focuses on the former
and the following section on the latter.
We embed the deterministic impact condition using Eq. (5)
for each curve of the interacting robot and object. Additionally,
if no impact occurs, the Bezier curves of robots and objects
should be smooth via
R(k  1)  x
O(k  1)  x
Although we do not explicitly consider any uncertainty in
the robot dynamics or impact kinematics, a common choice in
trajectory planning with spatio-temporal specifications such as
is a generalization of a piece-wise linear trajectory, we can rely
on  or  to embed STL spatial robustness according to
the definitions in Eq. (2). The spatially robust planner problem

goal while all systems should avoid the red obstacles. (b) the spatially-robust plan from the offline planner in IV-B with two impacts denoted by I1 and I2.
(c) the vertical position over time. (d) the vertical velocity over time. Notice that the velocity (and therefore position) of O1 can only be changed via impacts
with R1 or R2. The change in velocity is instantaneous, according to the impact kinematics in Eq. (5).
is formulated as
J(rRi, hRi, rOj, hOj)  (xR, xO),
Mplanner(xRi(t), xOj(t))
if impact(xRi, xOj, t)
otherwise
Mplanner(xOj(t), xRi(t))
if impact(xOj, xRi, t)
otherwise
(9a), (9b), (9e), Ri R, Oi O,
where we reiterate that for the planner, xSi  [pSi, pSi]T and
pSi and pSi can be constructed from the Bezier curves rSi
and hSi according to Eq. (11).
The solution of Eq. (15) ensure that R and O satisfy  with
maximal spatial robustness, adhering to velocity constraints,
avoiding collisions between objects and robots and resolving
the impact times and positions.
Example 2. Consider again the corridor scenario in Fig. 4(a).
The initial and final static positions for R1 and R2 are [1, 0]
and [8, 0] respectively. As we maximize the spatial robustness
Si Si, O1 is pushed by R1 to move towards
the goal, maximizing the distance the walls and the goals
boundaries (  0.4m). R2 catches O1 and brings it to
a standstill. Fig. 4(b), (c) and (d) show how smooth Bezier
curves and piecewise linear curves construct the robot and
object trajectories. At collision, the velocity of the robot and
object is changed instantaneously.
C. Impact-Robust Offline Planner
The spatially robust planner can accommodate uncertainties
arising in the execution of the planned trajectory in terms of
STL spatial robustness. This model-free robustness metric is
not explicitly related to the most significant contributor of un-
certainty; the impact kinematics. To address inaccurate track-
ing of the pre-impact trajectory (in position or velocity), the
kinematic model assumptions, or inaccurate model constants,
we introduce the impact-robustness term , which captures
the permissible uncertainty in the post-impact velocity of the
objects.
object O, represented as an initial set X0 contained by the
zonotope ZO,X0 Rn. By ensuring kinematically feasible
robot trajectories leading up to the desired impact with O upon
execution we ensure that the robot can generate the desired
post-impact state on O for all possible states xO ZO,X0.
If we consider an interval-hull overapproximation ZO,X0 (via
Eq. (3)), this amounts to doing so only for extremal vertices
according to the following Lemma.
Lemma 1. Let Z be a interval hull zonotope of zonotope Z.
If for all v V ( Z) there exists a trajectory xR,v(t0 : tf) that
intersects v at tf, then for all x Z there exist a trajectory
that interests x at tf.
Considering an impact on all extremal vertices v V ( Z)
requires the creation of 2n Bezier trajectories, as this is the
number of vertices of an n-dimensional interval hull.
Let pv denote the position at an outer vertex v V ( Z) of
the interval hull zonotope of Z, we then obtain the kinematic
impact equation v V ( Z)
otherwise.
The uncertainty term  represents a deviation from the nominal
post-impact velocity of the object. The remainder of this
section is devoted to formulating the planning problem so that
the optimization metric in Eq. (9) is to maximize , i.e. the
optimal plan is the most robust with respect to post-impact
velocity uncertainty.
For the uncertainty propagation of the uncertain set ZO,X0
after impact, we use zonotope propagation on each vertex v
, zerosnk >,
which ensures that uncertainty in the post-impact velocity
translates to velocity and spatial uncertainty in the state
propagation
where c and G are from Eq. (18), dependent on the impact
condition. Since the system under consideration is a double
integrator without friction, as it is a floating object in space,
we can define the matrix exponential as eAt  (I  At).
Note that in the trajectory formulation in Eq. (11), t is
the duration of the temporal Bezier curve, h(s), which is
a continuous variable. This means that as t, pv,O, pv,O,
and  are continuous variables, Eq. (19) introduces bilinear
constraints. We remedy this by choosing a constant time-
discretization for the objects.
We continue this forward reachability process for all trajec-
tory curves by obtaining the pre-impact interval hull Z
bility procedure repeats itself for all impacts and non-impacts
according to Eqs. (17) and (18). An example of this procedure
is schematically shown in Fig. 5.
The impact-robust planner problem is then formulated as
J(rRi, hRi, rOi)  ,
Mplanner(xv,Ri(t), v ZOj(t))
Mplanner(v ZOj(t), xv,Rj(t))
where v p refers to the velocity states of the vertex v ZOj.
Notice that the impact-robust planning problem in Eq. (20)
does not optimize for the duration of the object curve (hOi) but
does face the challenge of increased overall curves compared
to the spatially robust planning problem in Eq. (15).
Example 3. Consider again the corridor transportation sce-
nario. The initial state of the object is now defined as a
bounded set, ZO1,X0  ZO1,X0. As we maximize the impact-
uncertainty in the post-impact velocity translates to spatial
and velocity uncertainty in the next pre-impact zonotope.
The increase from ZO1,X0 to Z
O1 is shown in Fig. 5. This
also highlights that we consider 2n trajectories of the robots
for the feasibility x
A second impact with R1, while also introducing a post-
impact uncertainty, allows redirecting the object. This kind
of behavior is implicitly embedded via the impact-robustness
metric  and not apparent when maximizing a model-free
robustness metric.
V. MILP ENCODING OF THE OFFLINE PLANNER
Given the planner from Sec. IV, we present its MILP
encoding. We detail how the constraints in Eq. (9a)-(9e) are
embedded in the offline MILP planner and how accelerations
of the robots can be attenuated using quadratic cost terms.
1) Specification : For the satisfaction of  for xR and
xO in Eq. (9a), we refer for details to  and . The key-
takeaway is that each Bezier curve is assigned a robustness
value w.r.t. space- or time-robustness, p(xS,i) or p(xS,i).
Using the recursive definitions in Eq. (2), the robustness
of trajectory xSi can be determined. The propagation of
robustness through  is reliant on min and max operators
over relevant time intervals I, which can be encoded exactly
in MILP optimization problems. Stay-in behavior for a convex
polytope RoI can be encoded as
(Hfr(i)(j) bf),
i N[0,N1]
where nfaces denotes the number of faces of the RoI polytope
in the linear inequality form, Hx b and d denotes the degree
of the Bezier curve. Additionally, collision avoidance with
RoI can be encoded by ensuring that all control points of
a Bezier curve are outside at least one surface of RoI
(Hfr(i)(j) bf),
i N[0,N1]
where the disjunctions over the faces of the objects are
encoded via the well-known big-M method.
2) Dynamics and Impacts: The integrator constraint in
Eq. (9c) and (9d) is apparent via the construction of the
trajectories in Eq. (11). For modeling of the impact kinematics,
we keep track of variables z(R,O) B(NRNO) indicating
whether curve Ni of robot R has an impact with Nj of

I2 and I3. Instead of a deterministic state for O1 as in Fig. 4, the post-impact states are now represented by zonotopes and the robot trajectories consider the
traversal to all extremal vertices. (c) the vertical position over time. Impact I2 at t 45s creates a decreasing funnel indicating that the overall uncertainty
in the system can be reduced by additional impacts (as all v ZO have a unique impact). (d) the vertical velocity over time. Notice that the velocity (and
therefore position) of O1 can only be changed via impacts with R1 or R2 and that any impact between O1 and Ri introduces the propagation of a funnel
due to the uncertain post-impact term . Note the constant time duration of of the zonotope segments of the object in (c) and (d).

smoothness and impact conditions

indicating that this smoothness constraint is only enforced if
this robots curve does not intersect with any curves of any
object. In a similar conditional manner, we embed the impact
conditions

(i)  m2 h(d1)
(i)  m2 r(d1)
i N[0,N2], z(R,O)[i, j]  1
V ( ZO,X0) and the robustness term  is added.
3) Velocity Bounds: Velocity constraints in Eq. (9b) can
be encoded due to the bounding-box property of the control
points of Bezier curve i of system S
h(i)(j) xS r(i)(j) h(i)(j)xS,
where xS and xS are the velocity lower- and upper-bound
given by the user or physical properties of the robot.
4) Collision Avoidance: As trajectories are parametrized
by Bezier curves or Zonotopes, collision checks between a
robot at time t and an object at time t relies on checking the
intersection of the entire curve for which t [h(0)
O ]. This is in sharp contrast with the requirement
that robots and objects should impact in order to generate mo-
tion of the objects1. A heuristic best-effort collision avoidance
approach is to indicate pre- and post-impact Beziers and not
constrain collisions on these curves.
We found however that this led to significant additional
complexity in the MILP as well as requiring additional
heuristics. To this end, we only ensure collision avoidance
between robots and between objects and defer any collision
avoidance between robots and objects to safety constraints in
the controller. If the trajectories of Si and Sj are parametrized
by Bezier curves (e.g. objects and robots in the best-case
planner or robots in the impact-robust planner), we can ensure
collision avoidance with
pSi(t) pSj(t)2 radSi  radSj, t
box(rSi(k)) B
box(rSj(l)) B
where Brad
denotes the infinity-norm ball with radius rad. If
Si and Sj are parametrized by zonotopes (e.g. objects in the
impact-robust planner), we can ensure collision avoidance with
pSi(t) pSj(t)2 rSi  rSj, t

restitution coefficient, c, is 1, post-impact bounding boxes are guaranteed
to intersect, regardless if the physical systems do.
5) Acceleration Attenuation:
As mentioned in Sec.III,
while the Bezier trajectories can be arbitrarily smooth and
adhere to position and velocity constraints, any constraint
on higher-order derivatives leads to non-convex equations
(according to the derivative of Eq. (11)). As such, we add
the potential to attenuate acceleration by the quadratic cost
J(rSi, hSi)
rSi(k)T QrrSi(k)  hSi(k)T QhhSi(k),
as described in . The introduction of this cost term makes
what was a Mixed-Integer Linear Program into a Mixed-
Integer Quadratic Program, adding computational complexity.
VI. ONLINE TWO-BODY IMPACT PLANNER
A significant assumption in the offline Mixed-Integer Prob-
lem (MIP) planner in Sec. V is that collisions happen between
point masses. The reason for this assumption is that for
point masses, all impact conditions are linear, enabling glob-
ally optimal solutions with spatio-temporal tasks via mixed-
integer programming. However, upon execution of the plan,
the physical sizes of the robots and objects need to be taken
into account via Eq. (6). Additionally, changes in the object
position and velocity require careful replanning in order to
generate the desirable post-impact velocities obtained from the
MILP planner.
To that end, we consider an online planner that, given the
currently observed position and velocity of an object, and
the desired post-impact velocity of the object, recomputes the
Bezier curves before and after impact. We enable the replanner
when the robot is on a pre-impact Bezier curve and the object
is on a free floating segment towards that impact. We formulate
the replanning via a Quadratic Program (QP)

where t0, tf, timpact are the start of the pre-impact Bezier, the

predicted pre-impact states of the object

where xO(t) and xO(t) are estimated positions and velocities
of the object at the current time of replanning t, xO(timpact,i
denotes the estimated position of the object at the impact time,
impact from the offline planner, and x
of object O at impact i to ensure this behavior. It is x
is one the left-hand side of Eq. (7). Cost terms (29c) and (29d)
then ensure that at time timpact, the robot impacts to ensure
minimal deviation from the solution of Eq. (7).
Although the problem in Eq. (7) is non-convex, the offline
MIP planner provides excellent initial guesses on  and p
contrast to the offline MIP planner, this recomputed online plan
considers the physical sizes of objects and robots as shown in
Fig. 2. For validation, we include workspace constraints in
Eq. (29) via Eq. (21).
Remark 1. Not considering  in Eq. (29) means that STL
satisfaction is not guaranteed upon execution. Based on the
reference trajectories from the offline planner, the execution
realizes desired pre-impact positions and velocities of the
objects at the next impact, at the cost of accurate tracking
of the Bezier curves of the robots, whether or not satisfaction
of  is dependent on bounded-error tracking of the original
planned trajectories.
VII. IMPACT-AWARE MPC
We now consider the real-time control of the robots such
that Eq. (9) may be solved on physical free-flying platforms.

of the (re)planned Bezier curves under the planned impact
occurrence. An impact detector is used to ensure that the pre-
or post-impact stage of a robot w.r.t. the object is accurately
considered in the controller and online planner. We change the
weights in Q and QN based on whether the impact is in the
MPC horizon and whether the state k is before or after the
impact. Details are shown in Appendix. B.
VIII. SIMULATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we present high-fidelity simulator results and
real-world experiments on the ATMOS freeflyer platform .
Due to the fact that in our simulator experiments we run
the entire software stack existing on the robot (Software-

scenarios we introduce the quadratic acceleration attenuation

A. Simulator Results
We perform simulations in the high-fidelity Gazebo sim-
ulator. We simulate the entire software stack of the freeflyer
robots used later in the experimental results. For two scenarios,
we qualitatively compare the model-free spatially robust plan
and the impact-robust plan. From the impact-robust plan,
which has Bezier curves for all outer vertices of the zonotope
representing the state of the object, we interpolate these Bezier
curves to obtain a nominal motion plan.
1) Corridor Scenario: First, we consider the running corri-
dor example where object O1 is to be transported between two
robots. The planned trajectories for this transportation scenario
have already been presented in Fig. 4 and 5 for the spatially
robust and impact-robust optimization metrics respectively. We
define R1, R2 and O1 as the two robots and object with
initial and final conditions: R1(0)  [1, 1], R1(100)  [1, 1],
overall specification is for the object to reach a goal region at
100 sec. and for all systems to avoid obstacles.
[100,100](pO1 goal)
[0,100](pSi Wfree),
where the goal region is shown in Fig. 4 and 5.
For the Spatially Robust Planner the simulation results of
Fig. 4 are shown on the left in Fig. 6. Note the replanned
mass assumption from the offline planner has to be relaxed
and generating the desired pre-impact velocity of R1 requires
moving backwards to get more distance between R1 and O1.
Notice that R2 also replans and, as shown on the most-left
horizontal deviation in the impact.
For the Impact Robust Planner the simulation results of
Fig. 5 are shown on the right in Fig. 6. Notice that after the
second impact, O1 reaches the goal with a non-zero velocity.
In contrast to the spatially robust planner, where the non-
zero velocity was not planned, here this post-impact velocity
is specifically taken into account w.r.t. the satisfaction of
(indicated by the solid red line being between the dashed red
lines). The maximal uncertainty in the post-impact velocity

positive or negative deviation of 0.019 meters per second may
occur (both in the x and y direction).
