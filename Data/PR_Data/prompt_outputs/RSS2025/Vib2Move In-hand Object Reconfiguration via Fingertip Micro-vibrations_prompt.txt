AbstractWe introduce Vib2Move, a novel approach for in-
hand object reconfiguration that uses fingertip micro-vibrations
and gravity to precisely reposition planar objects. Our framework
comprises three key innovations. First, we design a vibration-
based actuator that dynamically modulates the effective fin-
gerobject friction coefficient, effectively emulating changes in
gripping force. Second, we derive a sliding motion model for ob-
jects clamped in a parallel gripper with two symmetric, variable-
friction contact patches. Third, we propose a motion planner
that coordinates end-effector finger trajectories and fingertip
vibrations to achieve the desired object pose. In real-world trials,
Vib2Move consistently yields final positioning errors below 6

I. INTRODUCTION
In-hand manipulationthe ability to reposition an object
within the robots graspis central to achieving dexterous
and versatile robotic applications. Among the myriad of avail-
able end-effectors, parallel jaw grippers stand out for their
industries. However, their single degree of freedom (DoF)
poses a fundamental challenge: it severely restricts the types
of in-hand reconfiguration that can be performed. This gap
in capability not only limits the range of tasks that can be
executed but also underscores the need for new methods to
enhance the dexterity of these otherwise robust and practical
grippers.
Prior research on in-hand reconfiguration can be broadly
categorized into two classes: methods that adapt single DoF
end-effectors (primarily parallel jaw grippers) and those that
exploit dexterous multi-fingered hands. In the former group,
one common strategy is to leverage environmental features,
such as walls or shelves, effectively treating them as ad-
ditional virtual fingers. These approaches often rely on
known geometry, friction properties, and precise force control
to achieve the desired manipulations. While effective under
controlled conditions, they falter when the environment is not
well-defined or when real-time adjustments in grasping force
are requireda nontrivial feat for conventional parallel jaw
grippers. Meanwhile, multi-fingered robotic hands circumvent
many of these issues by offering richer manipulation capa-

overhead often make them impractical for industrial contexts.
As a result, a method that marries the simplicity of a two-finger
design with the dexterity of more advanced end-effectors
remains highly desirable.
To address this need, we propose a vibration-based gripper
design that dynamically modulates the effective friction be-
tween the fingertips and the grasped object. By introducing
micro-vibrations at the contact interface, our design induces
rapid transitions between stick and slip regimes, effectively
providing high-frequency control over the equivalent grasp-
ing force. Building on this mechanism, we develop a friction
and motion model specifically for planar objects grasped
vertically in free space, where gravity is the sole external force.
Unlike previous approaches requiring detailed knowledge of
contact properties or object mass, our model depends only
on the geometry of the finger contact area. This characteristic
grants a notable degree of robustness by tolerating uncertain-
ties in friction and object weight, thus avoiding the fine-tuned
parameter calibration that often hampers manipulation tasks.
While we demonstrate our approach on a parallel jaw gripper,
the underlying principle of vibration-based friction modulation
can seamlessly extend to more sophisticated or multi-fingered
hardware platforms.
We implement this approach on a parallel jaw gripper outfit-

ted with low-profile vibration motors in each finger, employing
only on-off vibration signals for rapid friction control. By
integrating a heuristic-based subgoal generation scheme and a
closed-loop visual controller, our system can reposition planar
objects in free space without specialized fixtures or intricate
force sensors. Prior work has explored environmental-assisted
manipulation  and multi-DoF vibration-based end-effectors
[2, 3], but these approaches demand additional resources,
known geometry, or more complex hardware. In contrast, our
design retains the inherent simplicity and reliability of standard
parallel jaw grippers while offering a versatile method for in-
hand reconfiguration.
A. Problem Statement
Consider the exemplar task illustrated in Fig. 2. The goal
of the robot is to move the object from its initial configuration
in the grasp to the desired configuration. The object motion is
constrained to the vertical plane, where gravity acts exclusively
in the negative direction. We assume that the grasping contact
remains a patch contact with a constant shape and that the
friction is homogeneous. We also assume both the object and
the gripper are rigid.
e (t) SE(2) and qw
o (t) SE(2) represent the poses
of the robot finger and the object in world frame, at time t
respectively. We define qo
r SE(2) as the relative pose of the
robot finger with respect to the object frame, given by qo
o(t)), as illustrated in Fig. 2. The relative pose
r(t), deviates from its initial value only due to slip between
the finger and the object. Given an arbitrary relative robot

II. RELATED WORKS
In-hand manipulation has been extensively studied, encom-
passing both prehensile and non-prehensile strategies. Many
works focus on leveraging high-DoF robotic hands for dex-
terous in-hand manipulation. Both model-based and learning-
based approaches have significantly advanced these strategies.
For instance, object-level impedance control ensures compliant
6-DoF positioning while maintaining grasp stability during
contact reconfigurations, such as finger gaiting . Contact-
implicit model predictive control (MPC) enables dynamic
replanning under uncertainty without predefined contact se-
quences . Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated
success in handling contact variability and generalizing across
objects [6, 7], while hybrid frameworks combine RL for
planning with model-based controllers for stability [8, 9, 10].
man demonstrations simplify modeling by indirectly capturing
manipulation constraints [11, 12]. Parallel grippers have also
been studied for in-hand manipulation, primarily with planar
objects. Due to their single degree of freedom, their manip-
ulation capabilities are inherently limited. Karayiannidis et
al.  proposed an adaptive control approach for pivoting
with a parallel gripper using both visual and tactile feed-
back. However, their method focused solely on orientation
and was constrained to cases with gravity-induced torque.
Chavan-Dafle et al.  introduced motion cones, leveraging
the environment as an external pusher for manipulating planar
objects. In our work, we do not depend on external features.
Hou et al.  designed a unique locking mechanism attached
to the fingertips and two primitives to either roll or pivot an
object in the grasp. While offering significant dexterity, this
method also requires using the environment.
To address the limitations of parallel grippers, researchers
have explored modifications to introduce additional DoFs. For
into the gripper to enhance its in-hand manipulation capabil-
ities. Nahum et al.  and subsequent work by Binyamin et
al.  added rotation and vibration to the gripper fingertips,
enabling arbitrary planar object manipulation. In our work,
we employ a commercial parallel gripper and augment it with
vibrational fingertips, achieving arbitrary pose manipulation of
planar objects.
The modeling, planning, and control of planar object push-
ing or sliding have been extensively studied. Stuber et al.
conducted a comprehensive survey on robotic pushing,
covering both analytical and data-driven approaches. Lynch
and Mason  proposed a motion planning algorithm lever-
aging sticking interactions to achieve target trajectories. These
manipulation strategiesoften referred to as dragging or slid-
ingrely on quasi-static analysis, Coulomb friction with limit
surface modeling, and soft contacts for moment transfer. Kao
et al.  examined compliance and sliding mechanics, which
were later extended to the manipulation of lightweight objects,
such as a business card, using two sliding robot fingers on a
frictionless table [19, 20]. However, such frictionless assump-
tions are impractical for heavier objects. Ghazaei et al.
introduced a hybrid dynamical system to predict and control
object motion under conditions such as sticking, slipping, and
pivoting. While this work addressed some dynamic challenges,
the associated planning problem remains unresolved. Efforts
to minimize unintended slippage  and to develop model-
free dragging methods for objects with unknown dynamics
have demonstrated potential but are generally constrained
to planar translation or simulation environments. More recent
studies by Yi et al. [24, 25] advanced planar sliding using
horizontal or tilted supporting surfaces, further pushing the
boundaries of the field. While these works mark significant
such methods to more complex and dynamic tasks.
Vibration has long been considered an effective form of
actuation and has been widely deployed in applications such as
conveyor belts. In the field of topography, the friction-reducing
effects of vibration are well-documented. Numerous analytical
and experimental  studies have provided explanations
for this phenomenon. Due to its simple structure and ease
of activation, vibration has found extensive use in industry,
particularly in conveyor belts . In recent years, roboticists
have also explored the use of vibration in robotics. The stick-
slip effect  forms the basis for vibration-based manipula-
through static friction (with no movement) and sliding due to
kinetic friction. In [30, 31], the authors leveraged this stick-
slip effect to develop the Kilobot, a swarm robotics platform
that achieves effective locomotion. Several works have focused
on integrating vibration functionality into robot grippers. A
recent study and its follow-up [2, 3] introduced vibration to
in-hand manipulation. They proposed the Vibratory Finger
Manipulator (VFM), a novel mechanism featuring a rotary
finger actuator embedded with a vibration motor to manipulate
planar objects. However, this approach is limited to horizontal
degrees of freedom (DoFs). Maruo et al.  presented a
dynamic underactuated manipulator that exploits structural
anisotropy in a spiral flexible body to achieve multi-DoF object
motion through vibration-induced orbit modulation using a
single actuator. More recently, Yako et al.  demonstrated
vertical vibratory transport of grasped parts by leveraging
impact-induced accelerations combined with periodic stick-
slip motion, enabling transport against gravity.
In this work, we propose a simple vibration-based parallel
gripper finger design that enables precise and rapid control
of the equivalent grasping force to regulate slippage. We
also derive the mechanics and motion model for grasping a
planar object in a vertical plane, where gravity is the only
external force and the contact is modeled as a patch contact.
Based on this, we propose a planning and control algorithm
to manipulate the object in-hand.
III. MECHANICS
To achieve precise in-hand object reconfiguration, it is
essential to understand the motions induced by the vibration-

A. Free-space Sliding with Patch Contact
1) Limit Surface: The limit surface defines the boundary of
all possible frictional wrenches a contact patch can exert on
the object. It also characterizes the set of instantaneous object
twists due to the frictional interaction at the contact [34, 35].
In general, calculating the limit surface in closed form is
impossible; however, the seminal work of Howe and Cutkosky
proposed an ellipsoidal approximation in the wrench
space that has proved effective in a variety of subsequent
studies [17, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41] and forms the basis of our
analysis.
Let w  [fx, fy, z]T denote the friction wrench on the
object from the supporting contact in the contact frame. The
ellipsoidal limit surface can be expressed as:
wT Aw  1
where A  Diag{(a1N)2, (a2N)2, (a3N)2}, N is the
normal force, and a1, a2, a3 are geometric and frictional
coefficients. Assuming isotropic Coulomb friction model, we
have a1  a2  , where  is the friction coefficient between
the contact and the object. We can represent arbitrary contact
patches using their equivalent radius ro . Using this radius,
we can write the maximum friction torque about the contact
normal as a3  r0c, where r0 is the equivalent radius
of the object and c [0, 1] is a constant corresponding to
object geometry. This constant is obtained by integration and
for a uniform pressure distribution with the equivalent radius

patch size, A N,  i.e., that the size of the limit surface is
proportional to the normal force while maintaining the limit
surface axes ratios.
As is standard with the ellipsoidal limit surface approxi-
mation [22, 38, 42, 23, 21], we assume that the maximum
static friction is equal to the kinetic friction under the same
normal force. Static friction wrenches are inside or on the
limit surface, while dynamic friction wrenches are strictly on
the limit surface. When the object slides on the contact plane,
the wrench wc lies on the limit surface and the surface normal
at this point is the direction of instantaneous object twist qc
2) Sliding motion model: In free space in-hand reconfigu-
The parallel gripper applies both normal forces and frictional
wrenches to the object through the contact patches. When
considering force-torque balance in SE(2), we focus solely
on the frictional wrenches because the normal forces from the
two contact patches cancel each other out. Gravity acts as a
point force applied to the objects center of mass.
The objects slip with respect to the fingers is induced
by vibrations. The objects motion is governed by the net
force applied to it through the contact patch and gravity.
In our method, we modulate the finger vibrations such that
the induced object slip is quasi-static. Here, modulation is
achieved by controlling the length of time for which the
vibration is applied. The longer the application, the more time
the object has to accumulate acceleration. By focusing on short

as soon as vibrations are turned off. Under this assumption,
the object always maintains force-torque equilibrium, whether
it slides or remains stationary, regardless of the exact friction
wrench. We evaluate this assumptions in the results section.
tact location, and equivalent diameter, we may write force-
torque balance as:
where [f w
f ]T is the friction wrench due to the fingers
in the world frame, xc is the distance from object center to
finger in x direction. We can rearrange to arrive at:
We observe that the robot finger pose does not affect the
objects motion directly; only the relative pose between the
robot finger and the objects center is relevant. Thus, when
planning the robots motion, we need only consider the fingers
orientation with respect to the world frame.
force or friction coefficient to determine the frictional wrench.
wrench. This choice reflects the fact that the shape of the
fingers limit surface depends solely on the contacts radius,
whereas the normal force and friction coefficient merely scale
the size of the limit surface. By enforcing the wrench balance,
effectively select the corresponding limit surface size.
As discussed in the previous subsection, when the wrench
lies on limit surface, the object either sticks to the robot finger
or slides along the twist direction in Eq. 1. We also assume
that whenever vibration is applied, the object must slide; when
vibration ceases, the object maintains sticking contact with the
robot finger.
Using the limit surface friction model described, we can
determine the contacts motion direction:
where wf  [fx, fy, f]T and q denotes the instantaneous
motion of the object. Notably, Eq. 4 indicates only the direc-
tion of motion and not its magnitude. Given the direction, we
can apply a small time step to update the objects pose in the
gripper contact frame. This small time step approximates the
instantaneous object motion. Thus, we can predict the motion
By employing sufficiently small time steps, we can approx-
imate the trajectory without requiring time increments that
scale linearly with the motion. To regulate the update, we
instead use a unit-distance step. However, because the twist

linear and angular velocitiesthe system exhibits faster mo-
tion when it is closer to pure rotation than when it is primarily
translational. This limitation arises from relying solely on the
limit surface (LS) model under quasi-static assumptions.
In Eq. 2, enforcing force and torque balance effectively fixes
the size of the limit surface, which reflects amount of friction
needed to balance the object. A larger limit surface implies
a greater frictional requirement to maintain equilibrium. We
treat the scale of this limit surface intuitively as a scale factor
for the twist, leading to a modified motion update equation:
where k is proportional to the limit surface size. With this
modified motion update method, we can obtain a more realistic
motion prediction. One sample of in-hand object motion is
plotted in Fig. 5.
B. Vibration
The motion model described above provides the foundation
for understanding object reconfiguration under quasi-static
assumption. Vibration is the means by which we are able to
modify friction at the contact interface which in turn affects
motion. Fingertip vibrations reduce the effective average nor-
mal force imparted to the object, thus reducing the effective
friction force. This is because contact between the object and
robot is continuously and very rapidly broken.
Vibration has been extensively studied in tribology, with
both theoretical studies and experimental results demonstrating
that sliding friction decreases when vibrations are applied
either tangentially  or normal  to the contact surface.
The primary advantage of using vibration, rather than directly
controlling the grasping force, lies in its ability to change state
on the order of milliseconds. Conventional grippers, on the
grasping forces in such a short interval. For our task, the ability
to change rapidly is critical.
IV. MOTION PLANNING FOR IN-HAND RECONFIGURATION
In this section, we develop our proposed planning algorithm
that guides the object to its target pose. Under the assumption
that the object only slides when vibration is applied, we define
two primitives, illustrated in Fig. 6:
(a) Reorient the gripper without vibration  the relative pose
between the object and the fingertip is fixed. However,
by reorienting the gripper and object, we alter the gravi-
tational torque on the gripper.
(b) Keep the grippers pose fixed and apply vibration  we
apply vibration to gradually change the relative pose
through sliding, as described in the previous section.
Primitive (a) affords the ability to predict the future object
motions using Eq. 6 and primitive (b) realizes the motion.
Since Eq. 6 does not provide a precise timestep, we use pose
feedback to locate the object rather than execute in open-loop.
The key insight we use to derive our control strategy is
obtained by carefully studying our models predictions. As
illustrated in Fig. 5, under robot motion type (b), all object
motions can effectively be grouped into two categories:
1) Linear motion along the direction of gravity.
2) Near-pure rotational motion.
Linear motion along the direction of gravity occurs when
the line connecting the objects center of mass (CoM) and the
contact patchs center is parallel to gravity. This scenario has

per without vibration, (b) robot stops moving (fixed gripper
pose) and vibrates the fingertips allowing the object to slide.
two distinct cases depending on whether the CoM lies above
or below the contact center. If the CoM is above, the motion
is sensitive to initial pose errors and can diverge to the second
category. Conversely, if the CoM is below the contact center,
the object slides stably along the gravity direction.
The object tends toward a near-pure rotational motion about
the contact patch when the condition for the previous case is
not met. In summary, the contact can either translate toward or
away from the objects center or rotate until the line connecting
the objects center of mass and the contact patchs center aligns
with gravity. This behavior makes it difficult to formulate MPC
or other conventional control methods, since it is non-convex
and requires a long horizon to predict a feasible path.
ating a feasible path, informed by our understanding of the
sliding motion behavior (see Fig. 7). Based on the aforemen-
tioned properties, we observe that the object can be rotated at
any pose as long as gravitational torque is present, and that it
can only be translated toward or away from its center of mass.
Our planning pipeline is outlined as follows:
1) Centering the Object: Repeat the following motion until
it reaches within an error ball at center of gripper: xw
o  < rerror: Rotate the gripper so that the
object center is right above the gripper, then vibrate.
2) Positioning to the Goal: Repeat the following motion
until it reaches within an error ball at goal position: xw
g  < rerror: Rotate the gripper so that the
object center is directly below the goal pose, then vibrate.
3) Adjusting Orientation: Repeat the following motion
until the relative orientation reaches the goal: w
g < rerror: Rotate the gripper so that the object
center is not right above or below gripper, then vibrate.
At the end of the first or second stage, when the distance
between the finger and the objects center approaches zero,
the system enters a singularity that destabilizes the fingers
orientation. To mitigate this, we define an error region with
radius rerror. Once the finger is within this error region,
we proceed to the next stage. If rerror is too large, the
finger remains far from the objects center, potentially causing
excessive gravitational torque and motion failure in the next
stage. Conversely, if rerror is too small, the system may
approach singularity and fail. In our setup, we chose to use 5
[mm] as the radius rerror.
In practice, the pressure center of the patch contact does not
always coincide with the geometric center of the contact due to
friction throughout the gripper system. Therefore, we estimate
the pressure center to execute a feasible path. Additionally,
because the system is unstable in the first stage, requiring pose
feedback for stable execution, we incorporate a PI controller
at each step to compensate for system errors or adjust pose
estimates. Our system operates through discretized motion, it
behaves as a first-order system, where the PI controller ensures
stable control. As outlined in Algorithm 1, each vibration step
includes an observation step to update the estimated object
reconfiguration process. We validate our planning and control
algorithm in the results section.

V. EXPERIMENTS
In our experiments, we evaluate both our motion model
and our planning and control pipeline for free-space in-
hand reconfiguration. All experiments are conducted in real-
world settings, due to the challenges of accurately simulating
vibration.
Fig. 7: The step-by-step in-hand reconfiguration pipeline
A. Experiment setup
For our real-world experiments, we mount the vibration-
based fingers on a WSG-50 gripper, which is attached to
a Kuka iiwa Med R820 robot arm, as shown in Fig.8(a).
The finger attachments are PLA 3D-printed and feature a
hollow chamber to house the vibration motors (Fig.8(b)). Each
fingertip incorporates a 10 [mm] diameter DC vibration motor
(Model: DXD-B1030X50-3CW-0.3PS coin motor, Zard Zoop).
The contact surface of the fingertip is 30 [mm] in diameter,
and to enhance compliance and achieve a more uniform
pressure distribution, we cover the surface with paper tape.
Two vibration motors, one on each side, share the same power
supply and are controlled by a Raspberry Pi 3B running ROS.
The motors operate at a constant voltage of 4.0 [V] using on-
off switching via a relay. This design is simple, reproducible,
and adaptable for other gripper platforms.
We define a vertical working plane for the robot so that the
gripper and object operate in an SE(2) plane, chosen to maxi-
mize the robots workspace. An Intel RealSense D415 camera
is fixed to observe this plane, providing real-time object pose
estimation. All experimental objects are planar, including six
shapes with different geometries, surface materials, and mass
distributions. Specifically, we use five acrylic plates cut with
a CO2 laser, and one 3D-printed PLA plate. We also cover
one acrylic plate with paper on both sides to provide different
surface property. Each object is equipped with AprilTags for
pose estimation (Fig. 8(c)). Object weights from 53 [g] to 90
[g]. Details about the objects are listed in Table. II.
B. Motion Prediction Evaluation
To evaluate the in-hand sliding motion model, we compare
the sliding path of the same scene in real-world experiments
and motion predicted using our model. For each run, we
randomly choose the object pose, and fix the gripper pose, then
take a single vibration action, measuring the resulting relative
pose between the robot and object. We replicate the same scene
setup with the same contact patch radius (15 [mm]) and initial
object pose using our model for evaluation. We compute the
RMSE error between the measured and predicted object pose
with respect to the robot. We collected 1564 vibration actions.
C. Real-world Experiment Procedure
To evaluate the performance of our motion planning and
control pipeline, we first set the robot arm to a preset home

setup; (b) Detailed view of the vibrational fingertip featuring

pose within the working plane, then open the gripper and put
the object between fingers. Next, we close the gripper and
apply a preset grasping force. Once the object is secured, we
start our motion pipeline and record object pose and gripper
pose during the motion execution. We executed 10 motions for
each object, and record the path for further evaluation. The
root mean square error (RMSE) between the measured and
goal object poses, computed with respect to the robot frame,
is used as the performance metric.
For reproducibility, we specify the following details of the
experimental setup:
Grasping force: Empirically set to approximately 5 [N],
sufficient to prevent the object from dropping in the
absence of vibration while allowing controlled slippage
during actuation.
Pressure center estimation: Assumed to be located at
the geometric center of the fingertip contact surface.
Initial and goal poses: Goal poses are randomly sampled
within 50 [mm] translation and 60rotation relative to

From the path, we can devide the motion into two kinds: the

translational motion.

joint limits, we discard any sampled goals that require
robot end-effector finger orientation outside the range of
VI. EXPERIMENT RESULTS
A. Motion model evaluation
Table. I shows the quantitative results of model evaluations
as a function of the timestep chosen for our model. For all
vibration actions, the RMSE of goal pose is 1.849 [mm],
with 2.189 [degree]. We also note that the pose obtained
using the RealSense and AprilTags system exhibits noise
greater than 1 [mm]. These results are obtained by setting the
robot to a random configuration and taking a single vibration
activation action. The loss is computed between the predicted
and measured object pose with respect to the end effector. We
note that the prediction error is sufficiently small to suggest
that closed-loop control will be effective; however, there is a
sufficient discrepancy in predictions that would render open-
loop execution impractical.

To provide a more intuitive understanding, we also show one
