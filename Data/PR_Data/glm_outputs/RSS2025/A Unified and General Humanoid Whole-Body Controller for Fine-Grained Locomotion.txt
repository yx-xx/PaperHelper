the diagonal sub-figures, the range for the command is along the horizontal axis (bottom), and the
corresponding error values are indicated by ticks on the top-side color bar. The color bar in the first row is shared by the four sub-FIG. 9: Tracking error of the baseline policies HOVER and ExBody. We evaluate the policies on the walking gait, as the baselines
do not support gait switch without reference motion, and HUGWBC does not require upper-body reference motion and controls the whole-body joints. The
comparison forces HOVER and ExBody policies to perform tasks beyond their original design, resulting in poorer performance than demonstrated in their respective papers. We use the same evaluation protocol as in Tab. III. We also provide the tracking error of HUGWBC for reference.
