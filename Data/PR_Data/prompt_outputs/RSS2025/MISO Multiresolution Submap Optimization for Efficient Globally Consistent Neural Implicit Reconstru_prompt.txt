AbstractNeural implicit representations have had a signifi-
cant impact on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
by enabling robots to build continuous, differentiable, and high-
fidelity 3D maps from sensor data. However, as the scale and com-
plexity of the environment increase, neural SLAM approaches
face renewed challenges in the back-end optimization process to
keep up with runtime requirements and maintain global consis-
tency. We introduce MISO, a hierarchical optimization approach
that leverages multiresolution submaps to achieve efficient and
scalable neural implicit reconstruction. For local SLAM within
each submap, we develop a hierarchical optimization scheme with
learned initialization that substantially reduces the time needed
to optimize the implicit submap features. To correct estimation
drift globally, we develop a hierarchical method to align and fuse
the multiresolution submaps, leading to substantial acceleration
by avoiding the need to decode the full scene geometry. MISO
significantly improves computational efficiency and estimation
accuracy of neural signed distance function (SDF) SLAM on
large-scale real-world benchmarks.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, neural fields  have emerged as a new
frontier for scene representation in simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM). Compared to conventional approaches
based on hand-crafted features or volumetric representations,
neural SLAM  offers advantages including continuous and
differentiable scene modeling, improved memory efficiency,
and better handling of measurement noise. However, a crucial
limitation remains in the back-end optimization of neural
existing approaches consider increasingly larger optimization
problems that ultimately limit their real-time performance.
A powerful idea to achieve more efficient SLAM is to de-
pend on a hierarchical representation that explicitly disentan-
gles coarse and fine information of the environment. Equipped
with such a hierarchical model, a robot can perform inference
over varying spatial resolutions, e.g., by first capturing the
core structure in the environment and then optimizing the fine
details later. In SLAM, this idea dates back to several seminal
works such as . Recently, hierarchical or multiresolution
representations have also achieved success in neural fields
, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and cost-
quality trade-offs in many computer vision tasks. Nevertheless,
neural SLAM systems have yet to benefit from these recent
utilize the hierarchical form of the representations.
In this work, we develop a hierarchical optimization ap-
proach that directly uses multiresolution implicit features for
neural SLAM. This approach enables us to solve a significant
portion of the back-end optimization in the implicit feature
robustness compared to existing methods that depend on
geometric reconstruction , . To scale to larger scenes,
we adopt a submap-based design that models the environment
as a collection of local neural implicit maps. In this context, we
show that the proposed hierarchical optimization significantly
enhances both local submap optimization and global submap
fusion stages in SLAM. We apply our approach to neural
signed distance function (SDF) SLAM  and demonstrate
its effectiveness on real-world, large-scale datasets.
Contributions. We present MISO (MultIresolution Submap
Optimization), a hierarchical optimization approach for neural
implicit SLAM. MISO performs local pose and submap op-
timization and global submap fusion, which can be used to
achieve SDF SLAM from depth images or LiDAR scans. For
local submap optimization, MISO introduces a learning-based
hierarchical initialization method to generate multiresolution
submap features, which are subsequently refined through joint
optimization with robot poses. As a theoretical motivation,
we derive a closed-form solution to the initialization problem
under the special case of linear least squares optimization.
Leveraging this theoretical insight, we design hierarchical
encoders to learn effective initializations in the general case.
For global submap fusion, MISO presents a hierarchical
optimization method to align and fuse submaps in the global
frame. Compared to previous works, our approach achieves
faster and more robust performance by directly using infor-
mation stored in the hierarchical implicit features rather than
relying on geometric reconstruction. Evaluation on benchmark
datasets shows that MISO achieves competitive estimation
quality and significantly outperforms existing methods in
computational efficiency. Fig. 1 demonstrates MISO on the
real-world FastCaMo-Large dataset .

letters denote vectors and matrices, respectively. We define
[n] {1, 2, . . . , n} as the set of positive integers from 1 to

and SE(3)n denotes its product manifold. A local perturbation
on the tangent space of SE(3) is represented by a vector
R6. The exponential map Exp : R6 SE(3) is given by
Exp()  exp([]), where [] se(3) is the Lie algebra
element corresponding to  and exp is the standard matrix

II. RELATED WORK
We review related work on neural implicit representations
for SLAM, with particular focus on neural SDF reconstruction
and submap decompositions. The reader is referred to recent
tive representations including 3D Gaussian splatting .
A. Neural Implicit Representations
Neural implicit representations offer continuous and differ-
entiable modeling of 3D scenes with high fidelity, memory
such as DeepSDF  and NeRF  rely solely on 3D
coordinates and a single multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to
reconstruct the scene. However, this approach is insufficient
for capturing larger scenes or complex details, prompting
subsequent works to introduce hybrid methods that combine
MLP decoders with additional implicit features. The implicit
features are commonly organized in a 3D grid , .
To enable continuous scene modeling, trilinear interpolation
is used to infer a feature at an arbitrary query location that is
subsequently passed through the MLP decoder to predict the
environment model (e.g., occupancy, distance, radiance). Re-
cent works propose several alternative approaches to improve
the memory efficiency over 3D feature grids. K-Planes
factorizes the scene representation into multiple 2D feature
planes rather than using a full 3D voxel grid. Similarly,
TensoRF  employs tensor decomposition to compactly
represent radiance fields. PointNeRF  constructs the scene
representation directly from point clouds by efficiently aggre-
gating local features at surface points.
Hierarchical strategies for organizing the implicit features
have been particularly effective at capturing different levels
of detail while maintaining efficiency , , .
DVGO  performs progressive scaling that gradually in-
creases the feature grid resolution during training. InstantNGP
significantly accelerates feature grid training and infer-
ence by introducing a multiresolution hash encoding scheme.
Neuralangelo  extends this concept with a coarse-to-fine
optimization scheme that preserves fine-grained details. In
sentations for large scenes by varying spatial resolution where
SDF mapping by combining octree-based coarse SDF and
multiresolution feature grids, where the latter is optimized
to learn residual geometry. Hierarchical representations have
also been explored for fast RGB-D surface reconstruction
, . In this work, we leverage these hierarchical neural
representations to achieve efficient and accurate back-end
optimization for neural SLAM.
B. Neural SDF SLAM
Recent SLAM systems have achieved remarkable progress
by modeling the environment using neural implicit SDF.
Building on DeepSDF , iSDF  uses a single MLP for
online SDF reconstruction from streaming RGB-D data. iSDF
selects keyframes based on information gain  and samples
free-space and near-surface points along camera rays to train
the MLP. VoxFusion  leverages a sparse octree to organize
implicit features and Morton coding for efficient allocation and
environments. Vox-Fusion  extends the method to large-
scale scenes through submap support. NICER-SLAM
transforms estimated SDF to density for volume rendering
during monocular SLAM. NeRF-LOAM  similarly uses
SDF to represent the geometry for neural lidar odometry
and mapping, and develops a dynamic voxel embeddings
generation method to speed up octree queries. PIN-SLAM
reconstructs SDF via sparse neural point features, and employs
voxel hashing to speed up spatial querying for online SLAM.
PINGS  is a concurrent work that extends PIN-SLAM
to enable photorealistic rendering via Gaussian Splatting. The
neural point features are decoded to spawn Gaussian primitives
enhance geometric consistency. ESLAM  uses multi-scale
axis-aligned tri-plane feature grids with a TSDF representation
to achieve memory-efficient reconstruction and localization.
