vehicle platforms and terrain properties. Furthermore, different

I. INTRODUCTION
Off-road autonomous mobile robots present unique opportu-
nities in search and rescue, environment monitoring, scientific
autonomy presents unique challenges to both robot percep-
tion and vehicle mobility that distinguish from structured
on-road environments [1, 2, 3], such as variable geometry,
deformable surfaces, and natural obstacles. Considering recent
are necessary to objectively and quantitatively evaluate and
compare the progress of the off-road robotics community.
Unlike off-road perception, evaluating off-road mobility is
more difficult. A plethora of off-road perception datasets [4, 5,
labels to evaluate against perception systems outputs, since
the robot actions can be recorded and fed into the perception
all). However, mobility systems produce new actions to drive
robots to different states than those collected in the dataset, i.e.,
distribution shift, and thus cannot be evaluated by comparing
against a static dataset. Therefore, vehicle-terrain interactions
need to be unfolded during off-road mobility evaluation, which
creates difficulty in standardization across research groups.
Considering a lack of standard off-road mobility evaluation,
researchers currently develop their own benchmarks to evalu-
ate their mobility systems and re-implement previous systems
to compare against. Such a practice, however, leads to ad-
hoc evaluation in a few aspects: The evaluation platforms,
either a physical or a simulated robot, vary in terms of robot
physics simulation fidelity; The evaluation environments range
from handcrafted off-road simulation features [12, 13, 14, 15,
outdoor tracks [22, 23, 24, 25, 26], and large-scale real-world
testing facilities [6, 27, 5]; Re-implementation of previous
approaches on ones own robot is not only laborious, but
also subject to misinterpretation of implementation details.
general and scalable to all these aspects is desired for the off-
road mobility research community.
In this work, we present Verti-Bench (Fig. 1), a general
and scalable off-road mobility benchmark that focuses on
extremely rugged, vertically challenging terrain with a variety
of unstructured off-road features. The main goal of Verti-
Bench is to directly compare the performances of different off-
road mobility systems. Based on a high-fidelity multi-physics
dynamics simulator, Chrono , Verti-Bench encapsulates
variations in four orthogonal dimensions: Using the Sliced
Wasserstein Autoencoder (SWAE)  and real-world off-road
terrain data, off-road geometry is represented as a diverse set of
2.5D elevation maps; Ten terrain semantics classes, including
seven rigid and three deformable, are designed with different
distributions of physics parameters, e.g., friction coefficient,
cohesive effect, and soil stiffness; Different types of natural
tributed based on different densities; A set of off-road vehicles
with different scales (from 110th to full scale) and actuation
mechanisms (4-, 6-, and 8-wheeled and 2-tracked chassis,
single- and double-wishbone, multilink, toebar leaf-spring,
and special tensioning suspensions, as well as pitman-arm,
steering) are provided, with the possibility of adding cus-
tomized vehicles. Using Verti-Bench, we also provide datasets
from expert demonstration, random exploration, failure cases
(rolling over and getting stuck), as well as a gym-like interface
for Reinforcement Learning (RL). We use Verti-Bench to
benchmark ten off-road mobility systems, present our findings,
and identify future off-road mobility research directions. To

II. RELATED WORK
In this section, we review the field of off-road autonomy
and current evaluation practices to motivate Verti-Bench.
A. Off-Road Autonomy
Starting from the DARPA LAGR program , roboticists
have started developing autonomous systems to operate in
off-road enviornments. Compared to indoor or on-road op-
during the entire sense-plan-act loop: Robot state estimation
ous localization and mapping , are easily affected by the
unstructured visual features from the off-road environments
as well as noisy inertial signals caused by the extensive
vehicle vibrations; Perception is more than a geometric prob-
gravel vs. grass. Both terrain geometry and semantics need
to be represented [32, 33, 34, 35] for downstream planning
and control tasks; Off-road planners and controllers need to
reason beyond collision avoidance and consider factors such
as vehicle stability [36, 37], wheel slippage [38, 39, 40], and
terrain traversability [41, 42, 43, 44], oftentimes in SE(3)
instead of SE(2)  due to the uneven off-road terrain
surfaces [45, 19]. The recent increase in interest in off-road
autonomy  necessitates standard benchmarks to objectively
and quantitatively evaluate research progress from the entire
B. Evaluating Off-Road Perception
Off-road perception research still dominates the majority
of the body of off-road autonomy work . Fortunately,
evaluating off-road perception can be mostly carried out on
both evaluation and training of perception systems in a data-
driven manner, a variety of off-road perception datasets are
available for research in semantics segmentation [4, 5, 8],
freespace detection , place recognition , traversability
road perception system taking the recorded sensor data and
robot actions as inputs, its outputs can be simply compared
against the ground truth labels provided by those datasets.
A performance metric, e.g., segmentation accuracy, detection
struction precision, can then be computed to quantify how well
the new perception system compares against others. Unfortu-
such pre-collected, static datasets. Notice that while off-road
dynamics datasets  can be used to learn off-road navigation
C. Evaluating Off-Road Mobility
To the best of our knowledge, no standard off-road mobility
benchmarks currently exist in the literature. Unlike off-road
perception evaluation, mobility evaluation requires the vehicle-
terrain interactions to be unfolded, since a different action will
lead the robot into a different state absent from the dataset.
Such a distribution shift necessitates mobility evaluation to be
based on the unfolded, not pre-collected, vehicle trajectories.
To unfold vehicle-terrain interactions for objective off-road
mobility evaluation, the vehicle platforms and terrain prop-
erties are required to be standardized, which, unfortunately,
vary significantly across different research groups: Robots of
different sizes, weights, actuation mechanisms (e.g., wheeled,
new mobility systems with existing ones. The latter is usually
customized to fit for a different robot, potentially causing mis-
interpretation of implementation details; Different simulators,
e.g., Gazebo , IsaacGym , Unreal , and Unity ,
are leveraged to train and evaluate off-road mobility systems.
To improve simulation speed, most of those simulators do
not focus on physics fidelity, which is crucial for off-road
mobility on extremely rugged and deformable surfaces; In
the real world, small-scale indoor testbeds have been set up
with foam, rocks, plywood, and pipes to emulate vertically
challenging terrain in the wild [18, 19, 20, 21]; Enclosed
outdoor off-road tracks have been constructed to evaluate
aggressive autonomous driving [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]; A few
research groups have access to large-scale off-road testing
facilities with full-size vehicles [6, 27, 5].
With such diverse setups, an objective evaluation and com-
parison across different off-road mobility systems become
infeasible. Verti-Bench, based on a high-fidelity multi-physics
dynamics simulator, is hence motivated to fill such a gap of
missing standard off-road mobility benchmarks. Notice that
Verti-Bench is not meant to replace existing evaluation setups,
but to complement them with a new standardized option to
facilitate fair comparison across off-road mobility systems.
III. VERTI-BENCH
We present Verti-Benchs core high-fidelity multi-physics
dynamics engine, diverse set of off-road features, including
wide-ranging geometry, physics-grounded semantics, and nat-
ural obstacles, scalability to a variety of vehicle platforms,
and standardized metrics to quantify off-road mobility per-
formance. We also discuss various datasets we collect using
Verti-Bench to complement real-world off-road mobility data
to develop data-driven systems.
A. Simulation
Verti-Bench is based on Project Chrono , a high-fidelity
multi-physics dynamics engine with a platform-independent
open-source design implemented in C with a Python ver-
simulators (e.g., Gazebo, Unreal, Unity, PyBullet, MuJoCo,
and IsaacGym with well-known physics limitations especially
for differential-drive mobile robots ), Chrono is especially
suitable to simulate complex off-road vehicle-terrain interac-
tions involving suspension, tire, track, and terrain deformation,
varying terrain contact friction, vehicle weight distribution and
Freedom (DoFs), etc. In Chrono, vehicle systems and terrain
properties are made of rigid and flexiblecompliant parts with
shapes for collision detection.
One point worth noting is that Verti-Benchs choice of
Chrono as its core simulator is primarily due to its high-
fidelity multi-physics dynamics, a vital aspect for off-road
mobility evaluation. However, Chrono is not the best simulator
for photorealism, one focus of off-road perception simulation,
which is out of scope of Verti-Bench. For the perception
ground truth elevation and semantics maps and obstacle oc-
cupancy grids. Another point is that Chrono is not yet GPU-
accelerated. Combined with the high computation required for
high physics fidelity, Chrono can only provide slightly faster-
than-real-time simulation, depending on the complexity of the
simulated environments (e.g., areas of deformable terrain and
mobility evaluation, learning off-road mobility is expected to
take a significant amount of training time with Verti-Bench
(e.g., using our provided gym-like RL interface).
In Chrono, each of the 100 Verti-Bench full-scale environ-
ments is constructed as a 129m129m world, with a resolution
of 1m per pixel. Each environment can be down-scaled to cater
vehicles of different sizes, e.g., 16th or 110th scale. Each
pixel contains geometry, semantics, and obstacle information
(details below). For each of the 100 environments, ten pairs of
start and goal locations separated by 120 m are distributed in
a circular manner, leading to a total of 1000 navigation tasks.
B. Geometry
Real-world off-road terrain is characterized by various
geometry in terms of elevation changes, e.g., slopes, hills,
of such terrain can be traversed by certain types of off-road
systems need to decide which of them can be attempted with
what vehicle maneuvers. For example, a steep slope with low
friction cannot be traversed at low speeds, but large vehicle
momentum by high speeds at the bottom can help the vehicle
ascend the top; Approaching a deep ditch quickly may get the
vehicle stuck due to extensive suspension depression at the
suspension travel in order to maximize clearance.
represented as 2.5D elevation maps created by SWAE
and real-world elevation data. To be specific, we physically
construct vertically challenging terrain with boulders and rocks
and use a Microsoft Azure Kinect RGB-D camera to create
elevation maps of different real-world terrain surfaces .
We then use SWAE , a scalable generative model that
captures the rich and often nonlinear distribution of high-
dimensional data, as a feature extractor to reduce the dimen-
sion of the real-world elevation maps while preserving the
original elevation information in a latent space, from which
samples can be drawn to generate new elevation maps that
resemble real-world vertically challenging terrain. To further
introduce diversity and quantification of Verti-Bench geometry,
we scale the output of the trained SWAE to 30, 60, and
100 and denote them as low, medium, and high elevation
level (Fig. 2 top). Each Verti-Bench environment is generated
with 13 probability of each elevation level. Fig. 2 bottom
shows the histogram of elevation values of all three levels
of terrain geometry. High elevation environments also have
the largest variance (most rugged terrain), while low elevation
environments are smoother.
Fig. 2: Top: Low, Medium, and High Elevation Maps; Bottom:
Elevation Histograms across Three Elevation Levels.
C. Semantics
In addition to geometry, off-road terrain also presents
challenges in terms of semantics and its associated physical
vehicle-terrain contact features, such as friction, slip, and
deformability. For example, an autonomous off-road mobility
system should be aware that when driving through an icy
or sandy laterally inclined slope with low friction or high
to imbalanced load and then rollover is possible, respectively.
terrain elevation. We design seven rigid and three deformable
semantics classes with different textures and distributions of
physics parameters (Fig. 3). To be specific, the seven rigid
semantics classes, i.e., grass, wood, gravel, dirt, clay, rock, and
ficient. When a pixel is sampled to be a certain terrain type,
its friction coefficient is sampled from the corresponding dis-
tribution. We fix the restitution coefficient to 0.01 for all rigid
semantics classes. For the three deformable terrain classes,
i.e., snow, mud, and sand, we adopt the deformable Soil
Contact Model (SCM) based on the Bekker-Wong model
to simulate terrain deformation after wheel interaction: SCM
presents the underlying terrain by a 2D grid and assumes each
cell can only be displaced vertically and does not maintain
any history other than the current vertical displacement. We
hard-code three sets of physics parameters, including cohesive
deformability levels, i.e., soft, medium, and hard. Verti-Bench
also provides terrain with granular materials. But due to the
slow simulation speed when simulating thousands of particles,
it is only reserved for special evaluation circumstances where
granular materials must be simulated and simulation speed is
not of concern. All statistics of the ten terrain semantics classes
can be found in Fig. 3.
Fig. 3: Seven Rigid (percentage, mean and variance of friction
To create various terrain semantics while maintaining sim-
ulation efficiency, each 129129 Verti-Bench environment is
first partitioned into a 1616 grid, with each grid cell as a 99
patch (one overlapping pixel between every pair of patches to
assure connectivity). To emulate real-world continuous terrain
patches with same semantics and similar physical properties,
we employ a cluster-based approach, where cluster centers are
sampled from the environment. Each patch is then associated
with its nearest cluster center using Euclidean distance. For all
patches associated with a cluster center, the same semantics
class is sampled and corresponding texture assigned, with
each patchs physical property sampled from a predetermined
distribution (Fig. 3). This approach creates natural physical
variations within every region of the same semantics class
while maintaining semantics diversity across regions.
D. Obstacles
Undulating geometry and varying semantics require off-road
mobility systems to understand fine-grained vehicle-terrain in-
teractions when driving on them. Off-road obstacles, like large
boulders or trees, exist in real-world off-road environments,
which are simply beyond vehicles mechanical capabilities and
hence need to be avoided. We also include natural obstacles in
Verti-Bench to pose challenges to obstacle avoidance systems.
For example, a large boulder triple the size of the vehicle is
completely non-traversable, while a steep hill as part of the
terrain may or may not be ascended with the right maneuver.
We add natural obstacles as instances of the former. To further
promote variation, we randomly sample the locations and types
(different sizes of boulders or trees) of 10, 20, and 40 obstacles
to place on each 129129 Verti-Bench environment, denoted
as sparse, medium, and dense for obstacle distribution. We
resample a new obstacle if the old one is within 10 m of
another obstacle, a start, or a goal. Assuming a holonomic
point-mass vehicle, we also provide pre-planned global paths
leading from start to goal locations and avoiding obstacles.
Fig. 4 shows three examples of sparse, medium, and dense
obstacle distributions and their corresponding global paths.
Fig. 4: Top: Sparse, Medium, and Dense Obstacles (black) and
Global Paths (red) between Start and Goal (green). Bottom:
Corresponding simulation scenario in Verti-Bench (elevation
and semantics are removed for obstacle clarity).
E. Vehicles
We also provide a set of vehicle platforms in Verti-Bench,
with the possibility of adding new customized ones in the
evaluated on standardized vehicles. Compared to simplified
vehicles in existing simulators, the Verti-Bench vehicles are
more sophisticated and articulated, including enginemotor,
wheel torque, whose responses to complex terrain interac-
tions are simulated. To be specific, Verti-Bench provides nine
types of off-road vehicles, which are sourced from Project
and modeling (with a Creality CR-Scan Raptor 3D scanner)
of real-world scaled vehicles (Fig. 5). Those vehicles vary
in terms of scale (110th, 16th, and full scale), chassis
(4-, 6-, and 8-wheeled and 2-tracked), suspension (single-
and double-wishbone, multilink, toebar leaf-spring, and spe-
cial tensioning), steering (pitman-arm, rack-and-pinion, toebar,
bellcrankrotary arm, and differential), and tires (rigid and
reduced simulation speed). All vehicles, regardless of their
C framework. The C implementations are then compiled
and exposed to Python through SWIG-generated bindings.
F. Metrics
Verti-Bench automatically computes a set of standard met-
rics to quantify off-road mobility performance, while addi-
tional metrics can be customized as needed: A successful
completion is defined as the robot reaching within 10 meters
of the goal in less than 60 seconds. A successful trial may
include contacts with obstacles. Success Rate captures the
percentage of successful trials over total number of attempts;
Traversal Time indicates how long it takes to finish a suc-
cessful traversal; Roll and Pitch describes the stability of the
vehicle during traversal, whose raw and absolute values can
be used to derive mean, variance, and maximum; Vehicle
quantify energy consumption, planning confidence, and path
infrastructure to save raw vehicle-terrain interaction data as
well as to compute performance metrics.
G. Datasets
Using Verti-Bench, we also collect a few datasets to fa-
cilitate future data-driven off-road mobility research. Current
datasets are collected on the High Mobility Multipurpose
Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV, Fig. 1 right), while future data
collection can expand to different vehicles.
1) Expert Demonstration: A team of four human operators
collect 4 hours of expert demonstration of successfully driving
the off-road vehicle in different Verti-Bench environments. We
filter out all failure cases, e.g., vehicle rollover and getting-
2) Random Exploration: To facilitate off-road kinodynam-
ics learning , we collect a random exploration dataset on
different off-road terrain by driving the off-road vehicle with
sinusoidal steering and 2 ms speed commands for ten hours.
Each data collection trial terminates if the vehicle rolls over,
gets stuck, or reaches the environment boundaries.
3) Failure Cases: To enable future data-driven off-road
mobility by preventing vehicle failures, we also curate a
dataset of failure cases by providing the last ten seconds of
trajectory before the vehicle rolls over or gets stuck. We divide
all failure cases into two categories: (1) Rollover: the robot has
a > 30 roll angle at the end of a failed trial; (2) Stuck: the
robot does not move more than 1 m during the last 10 seconds
of a failed trial (with 30 roll). The failure cases can be used
to learn high-cost regions to be avoided in data-driven mobility
systems.
4) RL Interface: Although not being a main purpose of
vehicles can learn off-road mobility through trial-and-error
experiences in Verti-Bench. Vehicle states and actions, as well
as reward functions, can be customized by our interface, which
communicates with existing RL algorithm implementations.
Verti-Bench provides interfaces of different inputs to the
mobility systems, such as elevation and semantic maps, robot
inputs based on their evaluation needs.
IV. EVALUATION AND DISCUSSIONS
We evaluate ten off-road mobility systems using Verti-
hybrid systems. We present and discuss our evaluation results
and point out future research directions.

The three classical off-road mobility systems include
the robot on the global path and minimizes the error angle
between the desired and vehicle heading by regulating the
steering and maintaining a 3 ms speed;

mean to the current terrain patch and lowest variance;

The four hybrid (classical and learning) systems include
kinodynamic model (bicycle model for x, y, and yaw,
elevation map for z, and neural network prediction for
roll and pitch) ;
DoF kinodynamic model for trajectory rollout ;
model that learns to attend to specific terrain patches ;
traversability and then unfolds 6-DoF kinodynamics .
We reach out to the authors of the original papers for their
implementations of their mobility systems. Considering Verti-
Benchs focus on off-road mobility evaluation, we make min-
imal modifications to their implementations to interface with
Verti-Bench so that their mobility systems are no longer depen-
dent on any perception system. For example, visual odometry
inputs are replaced with ground truth vehicle states from Verti-
Bench; Real-world elevation mapping systems are skipped by
directly providing their systems with ground truth Verti-Bench
elevation maps; All learning systems and components in the
evaluation are not trained in Verti-Bench.
B. Evaluation Results and Discussions
The evaluation results are shown in Fig. 6, including per-
centage of Succuss Rate and mean and variance of Traversal
and tasks. We also present an analysis of failure cases shown
in Table I. All 1000 Verti-Bench navigation tasks have been
used to evaluate each mobility system (no task has been used
for training). A complete evaluation of each system requires
approximately 10 hours. All task configurations have been
documented in YAML files, which can be used by external

according to their specific research objectives and experiment
requirements.
In general, navigation performance significantly declines
with increasing elevation levels, deformable surfaces, and ob-
stacle densities, including reduced Success Rate and increased
Traversal Time, Roll, and Pitch. In addition to mean, the
variance of Roll and Pitch also drastically increases, indicating
much less stable vehicle chassis when traversing high eleva-
three categories, end-to-end learned mobility systems achieve
the worst performance, while hybrid systems outperform the
other two in general. While ACL is expected to outperform
end-to-end learning methods, trained from other sources, still
have much room for improvement in terms of generalization in
Verti-Bench. Considering failure cases, the systems fail more
frequently due to getting stuck than rolling over. While the
failure rates due to rollover are relatively consistent across all
with RL getting stuck 75.7 of time, compared to TAL and
TNT with the lowest getting-stuck rates (24.6 and 25.1
respectively).
In terms of elevation, for hybrid systems, TAL and TNT are
the two top performing planners among all systems overall,
achieving the highest Success Rate in all cases and lowest
Roll and Pitch angle in most cases. WMVCT and MPPI-6
achieve good Success Rate in high elevation environments,
but with large Roll and Pitch. Classical planners perform in
between their end-to-end and hybrid counterparts. PID, due
to its simplicity and robustness, performs very well in low
elevation environments, with EH catching up on Success Rate
when facing higher elevation. MPPI does not perform well in

most cases and only outperforms PID in terms of Success Rate
in high elevation environments. Notice that Traversal Time is
only averaged over successful trials and thus only indicates
how fast a mobility system is given navigation success.
For terrain semantics, all systems perform best on rigid
above 60. Performance drops significantly on deformable
Success Rates while end-to-end systems struggle below 10.
Mixed terrain results fall between rigid and deformable ter-
rain. Deformable surfaces also show increased roll and pitch
variance across all systems, indicating less stable navigation
and highlighting the challenge of modeling vehicle dynamics
on unpredictable surfaces.
As obstacle density increases, Success Rate declines and
Traversal Time increases across all systems, with the perfor-
mance gap between hybrid and other systems widening in
dense environments. Obstacle density does not directly affect
vehicle stability, showing similar Roll and Pitch mean and
variance.
Our evaluation results indicate the potential of hybrid
mobility systems to tackle vertically challenging terrain by
combining the best of both worlds of classical and learning
approaches. The overall success of TAL and TNT indicates
the importance of an accurate 6-DoF kinodynamic model
enabled by sophisticated learning techniques in conjunction
with a sampling-based motion planner. MPPI-6, with a 6-
DoF kinodynamic model based on a simplistic neural net-
introduced by WMVCTs efficient 6-DoF decomposition lead
to the worst mobility performance among hybrid systems.
The degraded performance of all hybrid systems when fac-
ing high elevation, deformable surfaces, and dense obstacles
motivates further research, potentially to both increase the
kinodynamic modeling accuracy and improve the sampling-
based motion planner. On the other hand, it is surprising to
see the superior performance of the simple PID planner in low
elevation environments compared to the more sophisticated
elevation environments. This observation reveals a tradeoff
between system complexity and performance when facing
simple environments. One potential future research direction
is to develop off-road mobility systems composed of multiple
planners with different complexities and specialties to fit
different environments . Lastly, research of end-to-end
learning approaches, despite their recent success in relatively
benign indoor or on-road enviornments, still needs to focus on
robustly generalizing to out-of-distribution scenarios, which
are very common to encounter in off-road environments.
V. REAL-WORLD VALIDATION
To validate the Verti-Bench evaluation results, we deploy
one representative mobility system from each of the three

Wheeler robot  on an off-road mobility testbed constructed
