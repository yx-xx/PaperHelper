the real-world tasks. The first row is the source demonstration, and the second row is the generated trajectories. The generated trajectories are based on the source demonstration and the target object configurations. The generated trajectories are consistent with the source demonstration and the target object configurations. The generated trajectories are consistent with the source demonstration and the target object configurations. {
