AbstractAchieving successful scan matching is essential for
LiDAR odometry. However, in challenging environments with ad-
verse weather conditions or repetitive geometric patterns, LiDAR
odometry performance is degraded due to incorrect scan matching.
4D LiDAR and 4D radar technologies have provided the potential
to address these unfavorable conditions. The term 4D refers to
point cloud data characterized by range, azimuth, and elevation
along with Doppler velocity. Although 4D data is available, most
scan matching methods for 4D LiDAR and 4D radar still establish
correspondence by repeatedly identifying the closest points between
consecutive scans, overlooking the Doppler information. This paper
correspondenceDoppler Correspondencethat is invariant to
translation and small rotation of the sensor, with its geometric and
kinematic foundations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method enables the direct matching of consecutive point
clouds without an iterative process, making it computationally
efficient. Additionally, it provides a more robust correspondence
estimation in environments with repetitive geometric patterns. The
implementation of our proposed method is publicly available at

I. INTRODUCTION
State estimation is a fundamental component in autonomous
safely [3, 7, 20]. Accurate odometry plays a critical role in
reliable state estimation by tracking the robots movement and
position. Therefore, LiDAR odometry has been extensively
researched to achieve high accuracy and real-time performance,
leveraging its superior precision and detailed environmental
sensing capabilities. However, scan matching, which is essential
for LiDAR odometry, is degraded in adverse weather conditions
such as rain, smoke, and fog . Additionally, most scan
matching methods, which depend on the geometry of the
repetitive geometric structures such as tunnels and highways .
4D LiDAR and 4D radar have shown great potential in allevi-
ating these limitations. Unlike conventional LiDAR, FMCW-
based 4D ranging sensors are more resilient to weather condi-
tions [10, 15]. Moreover, they provide 4D point cloud informa-
tion (range, azimuth, elevation, and Doppler velocity), which
has potential [7, 15] for robust scan matching in scenarios with
repetitive geometric structures.
Existing approaches related to correspondence estimation for
4D point cloud scan matching either rely on heuristic utilization

inherent in point clouds derived from 3D information .
Although FMCW-based 4D ranging sensors provide Doppler
velocity but still the correspondence estimation methods typi-
cally rely solely on 3D information [6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 23].
In this paper, for the first time,  Doppler Correspondence
a simple correspondence that leverages Doppler velocity is
introduced. This correspondence is based on the range and
Doppler velocity of each point. Unlike the iterative closest point
(ICP), scan-matching utilizing Doppler Correspondence directly
matches point clouds without an iterative process, as illustrated
in Fig. 1, while preserving a reasonable level of odometry
are summarized as follows:
A simple and novel correspondence utilizing Doppler
velocity is proposed for the first time. Geometric and
kinematic foundations of this correspondence are derived;
Doppler Correspondence enables a non-iterative scan
matching. Consequently, it significantly reduces time con-
sumption compared with traditional ICP methods;
Since the proposed correspondence does not depend on
geometric cues alone, it remains effective even in the
presence of repetitive geometric structures; and
Scan matching based on Doppler Correspondence achieves
performance comparable to ICP methods across diverse
scenarios and sensor configurations with less computation
II. RELATED WORK
A. 4D Radar Odometry
4D radar odometry and simultaneous localization and map-
ping (SLAM) methods have gained significant attention due to
their robustness in challenging environments, such as visually
degraded or bad weather conditions. Early work by Doer and
Trommer [3, 4] demonstrated the feasibility of fusing 4D radar
data with inertial measurements to achieve 4D radar-inertial
odometry (RIO). Using extended kalman filter (EKF)-based
through techniques such as RANSAC-based ego-velocity es-
trinsic calibration, which removed the need for tedious pre-
calibration processes. Building on this foundation, Michalczyk
et al. [13, 14] extended RIO methods, incorporating persistent
landmark detection and multi-state estimation frameworks to
improve performance.
More recently, as 4D radar point clouds become more dense,
researchers have focused on optimization-based approaches.
Unlike earlier Kalman filter-based methods, which rely on
sequential state estimation, optimization-based methods aim to
solve the sub-trajectory by considering the global consistency of
sensor data. Li et al.  developed a pose graph optimization-
based 4D radar SLAM framework that utilizes ego-velocity pre-
integration factors to improve robustness in noisy 4D radar data.
Huang et al.  introduced an enhanced RIO that integrates
Doppler velocity and RCS information to filter noisy point
Nissov et al.  tackled the challenges of LiDAR degeneracy
by proposing a LiDAR-4D radar-inertial fusion, leveraging 4D
radars robustness in the fog-filled hallway, while preserving
LiDAR accuracy in well-conditioned environments. Herraez
et al.  presented methods for pose estimation and map
and map filtering to enhance accuracy. Zhang et al.  and
Xu et al.  further advanced 4D radar odometry by modeling
point uncertainty in polar coordinates, integrating into data
association and motion estimation for improved performance
in adverse conditions.
B. 4D LiDAR Odometry
4D LiDAR is an emerging technology that enables Doppler
velocity measurements, offering advantages in environments
with geometric degeneracy or dynamic objects. Several recent
studies have explored the potential of this novel sensing modal-
ity for odometry and SLAM tasks. Wu et al.  introduced the
first continuous-time 4D LiDAR-only odometry method lever-
aging Doppler velocity measurements. Their method employs
Gaussian process regression to estimate vehicle trajectories
and correct motion distortion caused by scanning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Similarly, Hexsel et al.  pro-
posed DICP, which integrates Doppler velocity measurements
into the ICP framework for robust point cloud registration. By
jointly optimizing Doppler and geometric objective functions,
their method demonstrated improved registration accuracy and
convergence speed, particularly in featureless environments such
as tunnels and hallways. Yoon et al.  and Lisus et al.
developed correspondence-free methods that estimate 6-DOF
velocity directly from Doppler information without requiring
explicit scan matching and incorporate multiple sensors or
complementary modules such as IMUs or gyroscopes for full
motion estimation.
C. Summary and Limitations of 4D Radar  LiDAR Odometry
The 4D information of FMCW 4D LiDAR and 4D radar
has leveraged its advantages in three main directions. First,
Doppler velocity has been effectively incorporated into opti-
mization frameworks to improve accuracy and robustness in
challenging environments, such as repetitive geometric settings,
foggy conditions, or a significant number of dynamic objects [3,
have been developed by refining point correspondences, using
RCS information  or the uncertainty of point clouds .
recover full 6-DOF motion from Doppler information without
relying on point correspondences.
While recent advances have shown promising results, most
existing correspondence-based methods still rely solely on 3D
geometric information, overlooking the rich Doppler velocity
available in 4D LiDAR or radar data. Also, correspondence-
free approaches estimate 6-DOF motion directly from Doppler
measurements but suffer from limited rotational observability,
requiring multiple LiDAR sensors or an additional gyroscope
to compensate. In this work, we address these limitations by
proposing a novel correspondence formulation that explicitly
leverages Doppler information. Unlike prior methods, our ap-
proach associates Doppler measurements not only with transla-
tional motion but also with rotational motion from a single 4D
The remaining sections are organized as follows. In Sec-
tion III, Doppler Correspondence is introduced in detail, in-
cluding its geometric derivation and the rationale behind its
robustness in repetitive geometric environments. Section IV
presents the experimental results, demonstrating the effective-
ness of the proposed method across various datasets and com-
paring its performance against point-to-point ICP and DICP.
In Section V, the limitations of the approach are introduced,
addressing scenarios where the method may face challenges. In
Section VI, Doppler Correspondence is integrated with ICP to
compare its performance with ICP and DICP, demonstrating
its potential applicability. Finally, Section VII provides the
its potential for the field of 4D ranging sensor-
