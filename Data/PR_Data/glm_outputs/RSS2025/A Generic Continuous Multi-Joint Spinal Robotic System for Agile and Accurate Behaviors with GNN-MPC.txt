function is a
function that transforms the input features of the node and the edge
function that transforms the input features of the node and the joint
into a hidden representation. In this paper, we use a MLP to
into a hidden representation. In this paper, we use a MLP to
define the function. The message passing process is defined as
define the function. The message passing process is defined as
follows: for each node i, we compute the message m that it receives follows: for each node i, we compute the message m that it receives
from each neighbor j as m = M (hj ,E ). Then, we combine these from each neighbor j as m = M (hj ,E ).
