5 objects for Hang Towel and 5 objects for Hang Cloth. We report the mean and standard deviation of the success rates in Table XVI. We can see that SKIL consistently outperforms the baselines across all situations. The improvement is most significant in Hang Towel, where SKIL achieves a 40% increase in success rate compared to the baseline with the worst performance. This is because the baseline methods struggle with the complex task of folding a towel, while SKIL's semantic keypoints effectively capture the necessary keypoints for this task. The results also show that SKIL maintains high performance even with fewer training objects, indicating its strong generalization ability. The detailed results and additional analysis are provided in Appendix F. The visualization of the keypoint trajectories further illustrates SKIL's robustness and precision in handling occlusions and maintaining temporal consistency. The ablation study on vision foundation models confirms that SKIL's design choices, including the use of DiFT and RADIO, contribute to its superior performance. The success rates across different tasks and environments further validate SKIL's effectiveness and generalization capabilities.
